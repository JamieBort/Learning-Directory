## Purpose

<!-- The purpose of this directory is to [...]. -->

## About

This directory houses information about all the topics found in the Learning Directory repo.

## Resources

Resources relevant to this directory.

### Resources to explore

These will be deleted when I am done with them. If they are of use they'll be moved to the [Vetted Resources](#vetted-resources) section below. Or a relevant file/directory in this directory.
