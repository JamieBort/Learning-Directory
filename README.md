# Learning Directory

The purpose of this directory is to house all of the code I write as I learn new technologies and hone my skills.
This is to help keep my GitHub account organized.

Add a [Table of Contents](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18244417/how-do-i-create-some-kind-of-table-of-content-in-github-wiki) to this file. (?)

## Explanation of files and directories

For the most part each directory in `LearningDirectory/` consists of only one technology. And the name of that directory will be the name of that technology. For example [LearningDirectory/JavaScript/](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript).

Inside of each technology directory there will (eventually) be three sub-directories:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

For example 
[LearningDirectory/Node/Courses/](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Node/Courses) and [LearningDirectory/Node/Projects/](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Node/Projects).

#### Courses
The `Courses` directory will have the course work I complete via sites such as Udemy. As well as tutorials found on blogs and the like. 
The name of the directories in `Courses` will match the name of the course.

#### Coding Challenges
The `Coding Challenges` directory is the repository for all the online challenges I work on.

Some of those are:
1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
2. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
3. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).
4. [Coder Byte](https://coderbyte.com/).
5. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

#### Projects
The `Projects` directory will house ....

## Explanation of other files and directories in this repository.

#### .vscode
The [.vscode](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/.vscode) directory. This was created when I modified some changes in Visual Studio Code, I think.

#### .gitignore
The [.gitignore](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/.gitignore) file. This lists all the file types that I do not want this repo to track.
Currently that list consists of:

```
*.DS_Store
*.env
and
*node_modules/
```

#### node_modules
~~The [node_modules](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/node_modules) directory. I am pretty sure this directory was created when I attempted to use dotenv for my website work in this repo.~~

This has been removed. It should not be uploaded to git repositories.

#### package.json
The [package.json]() file. This one doesn't currently exist. But since there's a `node_modules` directory I expect this one to exist. There is a `package-lock.json` file so this is another reason I expect the `package.json` to exist.

#### .env
The .env file(s)... (not uploaded to git as should be the case)

[dotENV Professional Development](https://trello.com/c/CN0CvXEA/261-dotenv-professional-development?menu=filter&filter=label:none) Trello card for my reference - info placed there is for me to refer back to. 

(Note to self: consider linking to a google doc instead. Since info will be placed there and will not need to be dealt with in a Trello card.)
