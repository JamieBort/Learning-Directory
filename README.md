# README Learning Directory

The purpose of this directory is to house all of the code I write as I learn new technologies and hone my skills.
This is to help keep my GitHub account organized.

For the most part each directory in LearningDirectory/ consists of only one technology. And the name of that directory will be the name of that technology.

Each sub-directory of each sub-directory has (or will have) three directories:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

### Courses
The `Coures` directory will have the course work I complete via sites such as Udemy. The name of the directories in `Coures` will match the name of the course.

#### Coding Challenges
The `Coding Challenges` directory is the repository for all the online challenges I work on.

Some of those are:
1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
2. [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
3. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard).
4. [Coder Byte](https://coderbyte.com/).
5. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

For more code challenge sites see 'Online Games' of [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-FDmLzGuYkasZpv9A1gTEV396rtWAi1bnCDh2uE7Q0/edit).

### Projects
The `Projects` directory will house ....

## Explanation of other files and directories

The [.vscode](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/.vscode) directory. This was created when I modified some changes in Visual Studio Code, I think.

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/.gitignore) file. This lists all the file types that I do not want this repo to track.
Currently that list consts of:

*.DS_Store
*.env
and
*node_modules/

The [node_modules](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/node_modules) directory. I am pretty sure this directory was created when I attempted to use dotenv for my website work in this repo.

The [package.json]() file. This one doesn't currently exist. But since there's a `node_modules` directory I expect this one to exist. There is a `package-lock.json` file so this is another reason I expect the `package.json` to exist.

The .env file... (not uploaded to git as should be the case)
