# Learning Directory

## Motivation

The purpose of this directory is to house all of the code I write as I learn new technologies and hone my skills.

This is to help keep my GitHub account organized.

## Directories and Files

### Directories

Each directory contains information about the subject that is named by that directory.

Of note:

- Meta/

  - Houses info on GitHub account and repo topics such as `README.md` files, `.gitignore` files, and licensing.

### Files

- README.md

  - This readme file.

## How to use?

This is updated and maintained for myself. However please feel free to make use of it yourself!
