# README Learning Directory

The purpose of this directory is to house all the code I write as I learn new technologies and hone my skills.
This is to help keep my GitHub account organized.

For the most part each directory in LearningDirectory/ consists of only the technology that that directory is named.

Each sub-directory of each sub-directory has (or will have) three directories:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

The `Coures` directory will have the course work I complete via sites such as Udemy. The name of the directories in `Coures` will match the name of the course.

The `Coding Challenges` directory will have ....


# CodeChallenges
## Repository for all the online challenges I work on.

## Other files and directories

The [.vscode](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/.vscode) directory. This was created when I modified some changes in Visual Studio Code, I think.

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/.gitignore) file. This lists all the file types that I do not want this repo to track.
Currently that list consts of:

*.DS_Store
*.env
and
*node_modules/

The [node_modules](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/node_modules) directory. I am pretty sure this directory was created when I attempted to use dotenv for my website work in this repo.

The [package.json]() file. This one doesn't currently exist. But since there's a `node_modules` directory I expect this one to exist. There is a `package-lock.json` file so this is another reason I expect the `package.json` to exist.

The .env file... (not uploaded to git as should be the case)
