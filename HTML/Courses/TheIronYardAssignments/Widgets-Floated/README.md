# Activity: Widgets - Practice with Flexbox - Pair Programming

## Description
In this activity, you are given a partially completed website. Lots of the styles have been added to the CSS, but some styles have been left incomplete. The biggest task is to lay out all the page elements using floats and CSS.

The goal of this supplemental is twofold: First it gives you some experience implementing a layout with floats. Second, it gives you some experience seeing a slightly more complex webpage. Read through all of the HTML and CSS to understand how the site is put together and then step through the TODOs to complete the layout.

This site also has two pages:

* `index.html` - The homepage for our widgets site
* `products.html` - The products list page for our widget site.

## Instructions  
* Download the source files and unpack them
* Review the mockups, the HTML, and CSS
* Complete all of the TODOs found in the style.css file
* You will have to modify the HTML in this project, but only a little! You shouldn't have to do anything except add the `clearfix` class to some of the elements.

## Hint  
Don't forget, floats are a fickle thing. You'll need to use the `clearfix` on the parent of the elements you float. Also, some careful control of margins and padding is necessary in a couple places. Take your time and don't be afraid to look over the solution folder

## Solution  
* A completed version of this activitiy is located in the 'solution' folder. Do your best to work throught the TODOs before you look at the solution files.
* There is more than one way of achieving the layout. Your CSS properties might be slightly different from the solution file, but the result could look nearly identical. That is fine. Your goal is to match the mockup, not to exactly match the CSS file in the solution folder.
