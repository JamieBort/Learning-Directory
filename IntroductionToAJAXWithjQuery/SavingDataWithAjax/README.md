# Saving Data with Ajax

This is my directory for the first lesson of this book.
It is found on page 58 out of page 214.

NOTE: Chrome gave me the this error:
"Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'file:///Users/jamiebort/Documents/LearningDirectory/IntroductionToAJAXWithjQuery/YourFirstAjaxApplication/javascript2/pets.json' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."

To address this I am using this:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
(this was discovered here from this article:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10752055/cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-http-error-when-loading-a-local)

by typing this:
http-server -c-1 

into bash at this point:
~/Documents/LearningDirectory/IntroductionToAJAXWithjQuery/
