The `my_script.sh` file in this same directory is a scratch file I created to follow along with this article.

To execute the scripts in `my_script.sh` simply type a period, forward slash, and then the path to the file.
For example, if your location in terminal is the directory as the file, then run this command `./my_script.sh`.
If your location in terminal is up one directory from the file, then run this command `./<directory that the file is located in>/my_script.sh`.
