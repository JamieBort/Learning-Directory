# Merge Sort

The algorithm (pseudo code):
1. function to divide the array.
Takes in an array as an argument.
Divides the array into two arrays of equal length +/- one element.
Calls the sorting function on each array half. 
Returns the array sorted.
2. function to sort the array.
Takes two arguments, the two arrays generated in the divide function above.
Sorts them.
Joins them again.
