# Algorithms

The purpose of this directory is to house the algorithms I am working on.
Or to link to those algorithms in the directory of their respective language in which I am solving them with.

See `Algorithm Status` for a global view of the solved algorithms. And by which languages.

NOTE: note to self, cover Recursion and Memoization/Dynamic Programming.

### Resources

NOTE: If you don't see a resource specific to Algorithms below, look for a resource covering Algorithms and Big O notation or Algorithms and Data Structures in the [Resources](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/AlgorithmsDataStructuresAndBigONotation#resources) section of the `Algorithms, Data Structures, & Big O Notation` directory.

TODO: Clean up this section so that each resource below consists of only Algorithms content. If it consists of Algorithms content and Data Structures content, or if it consists of Algorithms content and Big O content, move it to the `Algorithms, Data Structures, & Big O Notation` directory.
