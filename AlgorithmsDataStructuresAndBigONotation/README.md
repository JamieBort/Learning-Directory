- [Must do Data Structrues and Algorithms - Interview Coding Problems from GeekforGeeks](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding)

  - ("Structrues" typo from website)

  - this resource is already added to the [JavaScript Coding Challenges](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/CodingChallenges) directory.

    See https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/CodingChallenges/GeeksForGeeks

    However it is possible to do the challenges in Java and Python too.
