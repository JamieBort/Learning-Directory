## Resources

NOTE: Each item below is a resource that covers two of the following: `Algorithms`, `Data Structures`, & `Big O Notation`. For a resource that covers only one of the previous, see its respective directory.

- [Must do Data Structrues and Algorithms - Interview Coding Problems from GeekforGeeks](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding)

  > This repository is a collection of my solutions to the must do probelms in geeksforgeeks

  - All code in this site is in Java or Python or C++.

  - ("Structrues" and "probelms" typos from website)

  - this resource is already added to the [JavaScript Coding Challenges](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/CodingChallenges) directory.

    See https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/CodingChallenges/GeeksForGeeks

    However it is possible to do the challenges in Java and Python too.
