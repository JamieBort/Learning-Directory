# Data Structures

The purpose of this directory is ...

This directory is going to be broken down into respective languages.
So that Data Structures can be explored and learned separately.

## Table of Data Structures

The `X` indicates that the language has that data structure.
| |Java|JavaScript| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Arrays| | | | |
|Graphs| | | | |
|Hash Table/Hash Map| | | | |
|Heap| | | | |
|Linked Lists|X|X| | |
|Maps| | | | |
|Objects| | | | |
|Queues (first in, first out)| | | | |
|Sets| | | | |
|Stacks (first in, last out)| | | | |
|Trees| | | | |
|Tuples| | | | |

## Directories and Files

### Directories

- Software Languages

  - Java/

    - Possibly to be moved or removed. This `Data Structures` directory should be organized by data structures, not by software languages.

  - JavaScript/

    - Possibly to be moved or removed. This `Data Structures` directory should be organized by data structures, not by software languages.

### Resources

Below consists of resources for more than one data type. Otherwise resources for a specific data type is in that data type's directory.

- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has a plethora of information for

  - data structures

  - coding challenges for Java, JavaScript, Python, and a few more

    (already added to the JavaScrip coding challenge directory.)

  - and **maybe** big o notation too.

- See `Algorithms Class Library Hours Resources` in the Activity of the [Code the Dream algorithms class](https://trello.com/c/Dalqc4Hz/1367-code-the-dream-algorithms-class#comment-652ea958927077bd56ac5507) Trello card.

- Leetcode's [Learn](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) page.

- By Language

  - [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) GitHub repo.

    > This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

    > Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README with related explanations and links for further reading (including ones to YouTube videos).

    > Read this in other languages: 简体中文, 繁體中文, 한국어, 日本語, Polski, Français, Español, Português, Русский, Türkçe, Italiana, Bahasa Indonesia, Українська, Arabic, Tiếng Việt, Deutsch

    - Algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript with explanations and links to further readings.
