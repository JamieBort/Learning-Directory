# Linked Lists

The purpose of this directory is ...

## Visual representation of a linked list

```
const aLinkedList = {
    head: {
        value: 6
        next: {
            value: 10
            next: {
                value: 12
                next:
                    .
                    .
                    .
                    {
                    value: 3
                    next: null
                    }
                }
            }
        }
