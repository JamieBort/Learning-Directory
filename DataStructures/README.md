# DataStructures

This directory is going to be broken down into respective languages.
So that Data Structures can be explored and learned separately.

## Table of Data Structures

The `X` indicates that the language has that data structure.
| |Java|JavaScript| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Arrays| | | | |
|Graphs| | | | |
|Hash Table/Hash Map| | | | |
|Heap| | | | |
|Linked Lists|X|X| | |
|Maps| | | | |
|Objects| | | | |
|Queues (first in, first out)| | | | |
|Sets| | | | |
|Stacks (first in, last out)| | | | |
|Trees| | | | |
|Tuples| | | | |
