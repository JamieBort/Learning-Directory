# DataStructures

This directory is going to be broken down into respective languages.
So that Data Structures can be explored and learned separately.

## Table of Data Structures
The `X` indicates that the language has that data structure.
|   |Java|JavaScript|   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Arrays|   |   |   |   |
|Graphs|   |   |   |   |
|Hash Table/Hash Map|   |   |   |   |
|Linked Lists|X|X|   |   |
|Maps|   |   |   |   |
|Objects|   |   |   |   |
|Queues (first in, first out)|   |   |   |   |
|Sets|   |   |   |   |
|Stacks (first in, last out)|   |   |   |   |
|Trees|   |   |   |   |
|Tuples|   |   |   |   |
