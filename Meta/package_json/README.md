# package_json

To house info on the package.json file in this repo.

#### package.json

The [package.json]() file. This one doesn't currently exist. But since there's a `node_modules` directory I expect this one to exist. There is a `package-lock.json` file so this is another reason I expect the `package.json` to exist.

Note, node_modules/ does not belong in a repo. Therefore there is no reason for this directory to exist in the Meta/ directory - node_modules/ will never be found in this repo.

However package.json files are pushed to repos, including this repo. So this directory may be needed **if information specific to this repo is needed to be covered.**
