  Including

  - Accept and respond with JSON

  - Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths

  - Name collections with plural nouns

  - Nesting resources for hierarchical objects

  - Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes

  - Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination

  - Maintain Good Security Practices

  - Cache data to improve performance

  - Versioning our APIs

- Look into this website. It might be helpful for learning APIs better: https://apiary.io/how-apiary-works

  > Write an API in 30 minutes. Share it with your teammates or customers. Let them use the API mock to take your API for a spin--without writing any code. Iterate, rinse & repeat. Coding can wait until you know what your developers really need.
