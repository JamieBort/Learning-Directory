## Resources

* Look into this website. It might be helpful for learning APIs better: https://apiary.io/how-apiary-works
    > Write an API in 30 minutes. Share it with your teammates or customers. Let them use the API mock to take your API for a spin--without writing any code. Iterate, rinse & repeat. Coding can wait until you know what your developers really need.

* [ReqRes](https://reqres.in/)
    >Test your front-end against a real API.

    >A hosted REST-API ready to respond to your AJAX requests.
