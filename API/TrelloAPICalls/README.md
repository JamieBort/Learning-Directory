# README Trello API Calls

## Steps to run this.

Install the required npm packages. To date they're `dotenv` and `node-fetch`. To this end, run `npm i dotenv` in the root directory of this project.
And run `npm i node-fetch` in the root directory of this project.

The `.env` file needs to be in the directory where `require('dotenv').config({ path: './../../.env' });` is expecting it to be.

When these above conditions are met, run `nodemon main.js` in the root directory of this project.

## Status

I am making api calls successfully via postman. 
Now I need to learn node.js better so I can make the calls in the .js file.

I learned that I now need to become more familiar with Node (or some other framework to make api calls that I can send to the website)
I got it working as wanted.

## Next Steps
See `I now need to learn Node.js better so I can send the data object to the page.` in the `main.js` file. To this end, watch Node.js videos, read documentation. Etc.

Go look at the [Node](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Node) and [Servers](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers) directories in the LearningDirectory GitHub repo for reference to learning Node.js better.

Now to explore api calls by exploiting the api - look at keypieces of info. Display them on the site. Toggle between types of cards. Etc.
