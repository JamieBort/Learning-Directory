# README API

The purpose of this directory is to learn how to use APIs.

## Status
Just finished working on [Trello API Calls](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/API/TrelloAPICalls). 

## Next Steps
Return to [Trello API Calls](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/API/TrelloAPICalls). See [Next Steps](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/API/TrelloAPICalls#next-steps) there. 

## Resource
Look into this website. It might be helpful for learning APIs better: https://apiary.io/how-apiary-works
> Write an API in 30 minutes. Share it with your teammates or customers. Let them use the API mock to take your API for a spin--without writing any code. Iterate, rinse & repeat. Coding can wait until you know what your developers really need.

[ReqRes](https://reqres.in/)
>Test your front-end against a real API
>A hosted REST-API ready to respond to your AJAX requests.
