#My GitHub API

###About
I am going to recreate this tutorial:
/LearningDirectory/API/GitHubRESTAPIv3CrashCourseWithVanillaJavascriptNoDependencies

by adding the dotenv package; which uses the require() method. Which is not supported in the browser.

Since it is not supported in the browser I will also be using node.js. And will be following what I wrote from:
/LearningDirectory/Node/NodePractice/TrivialExpressApp

[Trello card](https://trello.com/c/bt92aOAd/845-mygithubapi) associated with this directory.

###Status
Having touble. Need to come back to make proper notes here.

###Next Steps
Address the dotenv issue mentioned above by running a node.js environment.
