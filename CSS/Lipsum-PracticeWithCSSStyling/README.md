# README

This document contains some basic instructions for how to interact with this project.

## Solution Files
Solutions to the coding challenges are included with this activity.

Do not look at the completed code solutions, before you've evaluated the screen shots and tried to interpret the CSS. Once you've evaluated the design an styling, use the solution files to compare and contrast with your own work.

Note the structure of the solution code. Try to evaluate the ways your decisions differ from the solution code.

## Resources
The resources folder contains files designed to help you complete the activity. This will include screen shots of the completed HTML and files containing the text.

### Screen Shots
Screen shot of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work to try and determine if you are on track.

- *index_no_css.png* is a screen shot the rendered HTML before any CSS has been applied.

- *index.png* is a screen shot of the rendered HTML after it has been styled with CSS.
