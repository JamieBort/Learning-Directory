# Node
Note, not hosting sites. 

Also, note the relationship to the https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers directory.

Specifically, https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers/Node

This directory houses all the Node courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

This directory should have ONLY the following directies in it, plus this readme file:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

##What is Node.js?
From [this](https://www.simform.com/blog/best-nodejs-frameworks/) article:
>..more often than not, we do refer to it as [a framework]. However, Node. js is actually a JavaScript runtime environment â€” a platform to execute JavaScript codes on the server-side and make it portable.

## Courses
Udemy courses and the like.
Tutorials.

## Coding Challenges
Exercises from sites such as CodeWars.com

### Projects
I don't think this should be in here any more. But will leave it for now.
