# Node
Note, not hosting sites. 

Also, note the relationship to the https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers directory.

Specifically, https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers/Node

This directory houses all the Node courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

This directory should have ONLY the following directies in it, plus this readme file:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

## Courses
Udemy courses and the like.
Tutorials.

## Coding Challenges
Exercises from sites such as CodeWars.com

### Projects
I don't think this should be in here any more. But will leave it for now.
