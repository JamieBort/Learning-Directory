## .vscode config file

The .vscode config file should (often) be kept out of the repos.

Really good info here:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/57749909

See the [Workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#:~:text=Note%3A%20A%20VS%20Code%20%22workspace,feature%20called%20Multi%2Droot%20workspaces) in the VS Code documentation.

There is currently a .vsconfig directory in https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master and https://github.com/JamieBort/jamiebort.github.io
