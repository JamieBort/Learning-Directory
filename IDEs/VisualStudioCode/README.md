## [Prettier]

### Use Cases

Use Cases that I still need a solution for

- I am looking for ways to make keystrokes faster. Such as `command + c` to produce console.log().
  See https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/issues/193

- Search, find, and open a specific README among all the readme files in this repo.

- Closing all files in the editor with `command + ???`

- Collapsing all directories in the explorer (to the left) with `command + ???`

- Opening all primary directories in the explorer (to the left) with `command + ???`

- Opening ALL directories in the explorer (to the left) with `command + ???`

- Saving auto formats. It changes single quotes to double quotes. How do I make single quotes the default?

  - This happens with JavaScript and TypeScript. Prettier extension is the formatter for these two file types.

- Using just the keyboard,

  - change focus between the editor, explorer, terminal all in vs code

  - toggle open/close explorer and terminal

## Tips and Tricks

HOW to take advantage of the fundamentals.
