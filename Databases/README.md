# Databases

## Purpose

This directory is to house all the work I have to learn about databases.

See:
https://trello.com/c/LRB6uZnF/282-consolidate-a-list-of-sandboxes
for info on using repl.it
It seems to have a database component.

## Comparison table:

In a relational database, the integrity constraints are any constraint that ensures database integrity. They are defined for the purpose of atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, or ACID. |
|     ?     | Non-relational databases are better for unstructured data, which doesn't conform to a predefined data model and can't be stored in an RDBMS. Examples of unstructured data include text, emails, photos, videos and web pages. |                                    Structured vs. unstructured data. Relational databases work well for structured data that conforms to a predefined data model and doesn't change much.                                     |
