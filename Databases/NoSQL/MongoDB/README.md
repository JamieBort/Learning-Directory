# MongoDB

## Purpose

from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18938940/8210460

> Thanks @Mark, I keep forgetting this again and again. After installing MongoDB with Homebrew:

- The databases are stored in the /usr/local/var/mongodb/ directory
- The mongod.conf file is here: /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
- The mongo logs can be found at /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/
- The mongo binaries are here: /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/[version]/bin

This command should update your homebrew formulae to their latest version:
`brew update`
and then
`brew upgrade mongodb`
