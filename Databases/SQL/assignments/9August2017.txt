		- Key-value Stores
			- Amazon DynamoDB
			- key / value pairs
		- Columnar Database
			- EG: Druid
			- new to me 
		- Graph Database
			- EG: Neo4j

	- NoSQL Pros/cons
		- https://newline.theironyard.com/courses/10/objective_lessons/163#advantages
		
	- SQL databases
		- More rigid
		- Schema defined ahead of time
		- Made up of rows and columns
			- Columns define a particular datapoint
				- name, age, height, color, price, quantity, taxable, etc
			- Rows contain a set of data for each column
				- Doug, 39, 6.0, pinkish, null, 1, false, true, etc...
		- Tables related by keys and foreign keys
			- https://newline.theironyard.com/courses/10/objective_lessons/163
				- search for table example (user, addresses)
	
	- SQL Advantages:
		- SQL has been in use in production for 30+ years
		- SQL ACID transactions are extremely safe and data loss is extremely rare
		- SQL data normalization helps prevent duplicate data
		
	- Restore DB:
		https://tiy-learn-content.s3.amazonaws.com/27956d6e-people.sql
		
		- create database people;
		- psql -d people < people.sql
