This directory was added after taking Maxx Potential's Capture the Flag game. 

The `Cryptography/`, `Forensics/`, `SocialEngineering/`, `Steganography/`, and `WebExploitation/` directories are some of the topics in the game.

See the [Session 4 - Security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12N943Vb310FQrw9ChD23I8gnS_vqZ9-RwC_cHW1S5U4/edit) Google Drive doc for access to that game.
