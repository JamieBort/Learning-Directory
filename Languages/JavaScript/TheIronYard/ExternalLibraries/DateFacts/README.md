**Date Facts**
Use the moment and chalk packages and build a script that gives you information about the current date and time.

In this project, you will use two packages from NPM and make a script that gives you information about the current date and time. The libraries you will use are:

* [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/)
* [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)
When your script runs, it should look at the current date and time and print output that looks like the following.

Your colors may vary because of your terminal colors.
