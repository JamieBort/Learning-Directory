# Activity: Coffee Survey - Pair Programming
You are tasked with creating a survey to collect information about the tastes and preferences of coffee drinkers. This survey will ask some general information about the participant and then will launch into a series of questions related to their opinions about coffee.

Your job is to evaluate the data being gathered and to mark up the form using the appropriate input controls. Pay special attention to attributes (`type="text"`, for example) and provide labels for each input control. Group the questions in a sensible way using `fieldset` elements and don't forget your submit button.

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
