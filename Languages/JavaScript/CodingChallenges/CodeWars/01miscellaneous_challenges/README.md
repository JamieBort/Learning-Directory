# 01miscellaneous_challenges

This directory consists of two directories each containing files that I think Josh and I created to pair program.

I think using CodeWars.

I think that there are two directories because the file names are duplicated; possibly because they're identical files.

## Directories and Files

### Directories

- CaesarCipher/

  - These are not CodeWars challenges. But I am not sure where else to put them.
  - They were created with Josh when we were working on the other Code Wars challenges.

- pairprogramming01/

- pairprogramming02/

### Files

- README.md
  - this file.
