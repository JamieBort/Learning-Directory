# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher
Introduction 
The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.

More complex encryption schemes such as the Vigen√®re cipher employ the Caesar cipher as one element of the encryption process. The widely known ROT13 'encryption' is simply a Caesar cipher with an offset of 13. The Caesar cipher offers essentially no communication security, and it will be shown that it can be easily broken even by hand.

Example 
To pass an encrypted message from one person to another, it is first necessary that both parties have the 'key' for the cipher, so that the sender may encrypt it and the receiver may decrypt it. For the caesar cipher, the key is the number of characters to shift the cipher alphabet.

Here is a quick example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the caesar cipher. The text we will encrypt is 'defend the east wall of the castle', with a shift (key) of 1.

plaintext:  defend the east wall of the castle
ciphertext: efgfoe uif fbtu xbmm pg uif dbtumf
It is easy to see how each character in the plaintext is shifted up the alphabet. Decryption is just as easy, by using an offset of -1.

plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
cipher: bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza
Obviously, if a different key is used, the cipher alphabet will be shifted a different amount.

Mathematical Description 
First we translate all of our characters to numbers, 'a'=0, 'b'=1, 'c'=2, ... , 'z'=25. We can now represent the caesar cipher encryption function, e(x), where x is the character we are encrypting, as:


Where k is the key (the shift) applied to each letter. After applying this function the result is a number which must then be translated back into a letter. The decryption function is :

The ACII table I started using is https://www.asciitable.com/.
I would like a more authoritative one however. So I may try using this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII or https://ascii.cl/.
