### Problem Statement

You are given a _large integer_ represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the _resulting array of digits_.

Example 1:

> Input: digits = [1,2,3]

> Output: [1,2,4]

> Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.

> Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.

> Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

Example 2:

> Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]

> Output: [4,3,2,2]

> Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.

> Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.

> Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

Example 3:

> Input: digits = [9]

> Output: [1,0]

> Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.

> Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.

> Thus, the result should be [1,0].

Constraints:

- `1 <= digits.length <= 100`

- `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`

- `digits` does not contain any leading `0`'s.
