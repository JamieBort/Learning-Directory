## Problem

### Problem URl

https://projecteuler.net/problem=44

### Problem Statement

```
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?
```

## The approach

### One approach:

Check to see if Pj+Pk is in the pentagonalArray array (see the attempt03.js file).
If it is in the pentagonalArray array, check to see if Pk-Pj is in the pentagonalArray array.
If it is, address the 'minimised' criteria.
