### Problem Statement

```
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Completed the challenge.

Ways to improve the code below:
Minimize the number of 'if' statements below.
Remove line 36.
Generalize 'arrayProduct[i].toString().length' so that the code can be used for palindromes made from the product of an two digits of any length.
Refactor in other way - look for them.
```

- LargestTwoDigitPalindromeProduct.js - I am not sure.

- attempt01.js - I am not sure.

- attempt02.js - Working as I wanted. But not the right approach. I attempted to multiply two 3-digit numbers and then check if the reverse of their product turned out to be a palindrome. When it failed to be I diminished one of the 3-digit numbers by 1. And then found the product of the two 3-digit numbers again. When that failed to produce a palindrome, I diminished the other 3-digit numbers by 1. and repeated the process.

- attempt02.js - not yet created. Next attempt
  try finding the greatest palindrome less than 999 \* 999 = 998001.
  Then find the two 3-digit numbers who's product produces that palindrome.
