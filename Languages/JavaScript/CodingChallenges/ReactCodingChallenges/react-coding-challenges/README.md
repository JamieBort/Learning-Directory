# When could these be useful?
- Usage as short coding exercises, such as for interviews
- To test yourself/test your coding abilities under pressure
- For beginners looking for a fun way to learn React 

&nbsp;
# How do they work?
The scaffolding is done for you. Simply run `yarn` in any of the directories to start the application. Each application has a README with its requirements.

Some might require connection to external APIs, but all information will be provided in the inididual challenge readmes.

&nbsp;
# Have you got the solutions?
I have completed all the coding challenges to a high standard. If you're interested in being invited to the solutions GitHub repository, get in touch with your **GitHub username**. 

### Why are the solutions invite only?
People use these challenges for interviews. By putting the solutions behind a collaboration wall/invite-only repository we can discourage candidates from simply looking up the solutions.

&nbsp;
# Why does it take so long for updates/new challenges?
I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and all the other stuff. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges. Interested in becoming a collaborator or submitting your own challenge? **Reach out below.**
