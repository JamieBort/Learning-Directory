Using the data provided, write some code to solve the problems.

In this project, you are tasked with reading through a dataset that was pulled from Etsy.com. You'll be given 6 problems that need to be solved.

First, download the `starter_files` to get started. Inside of them you'll find the following:

[Link to the `starter_files`](https://github.com/JamieBort/EtsyData/tree/master/SourceFiles/starter_files).

* `index.html` Main HTML file.
* `main.js`: This is the file you will do all of your work in.
* `data.js`: This file contains the data you'll work with.
* `logger.js`: This file helps log out the data to the console.

Feel free to peek in the `data` and `logger` files, but you'll do all of your work in the `main.js` file. They have also already been properly linked up for you in the `index.html` file, so open that in Chrome to get started.

## Questions & Answers  

Please note that the answers below must be identical when you open up your developer console and view the logged out data.

Since it will be logged out, please use `console.log()` statements in each of the functions to output the data. Also don't worry about calling the function, the `logger` file will do that for you.
