# Customer Database
In this project, you'll generate a page of all of your customers so you can browse at your leisure.

Often times you'll be given a set of data that you need to display in an easy to digest fashion. In this project, that data is a list of 12 of your customers. You'll need to style a document that looks similar to the mockup provide below that shows the list of your customers.

Inside of the `starter_files`, you'll find two files.

* `index.html`: Your working HTML file
* `customers.js`: Your customer data

You'll need to create your `main.js` and `styles.css` file and link them up properly. Once you do that, you'll need to use the object `customers` that is in the `customers.js` file to display the people on the page.

You should do your best to match the mockup as perfect as possible. The only thing you can omit is the blurred out SSN unless you attempt the Hard Mode listed below.

## Hints

Before getting too deep, make sure to `console.log()` your `customers` object and inspect it thoroughly. This is based on real data received from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). You don't need to visit their site, but if you are curious you can read more about their [API](https://randomuser.me/documentation) here. Everything you need for the mockup is listed in the data, including the user image.

You'll also want to make heavy use of Template Literals, as they will speed up your development greatly.

Lastly, we purposefully didn't include any HTML or CSS. That is completely up to you to make the decision on how you will handle that. We would suggest you spend a few minutes planning that out before getting started.

## Hard Mode

You'll notice in the mockup, their SSN is listed. You should display this on the page as well, but have it be blurred out by default. Then on hover, allow the user to see it.
