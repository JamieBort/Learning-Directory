## Implement a Responsive Layout with 2 Breakpoints  
Download the assets folder and follow the steps below.

Files to fork from [Here](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/Daily-Project-Responsive-Page-Layout-Build)

The downloaded zip contains two subfolders, `resources` and `starter_files`.

* Open `mobile.png`, `tablet.png`, and `desktop.png` with Preview.
* Open the `starter_files` folder in your text editor.
