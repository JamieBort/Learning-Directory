*/

// 1. First select and store the elements you'll be working with
// 2. Create your `submit` event for getting the user's search term
// 3. Create your `fetch` request that is called after a submission
// 4. Create a way to append the fetch results to your page
// 5. Create a way to listen for a click that will play the song in the audio play
