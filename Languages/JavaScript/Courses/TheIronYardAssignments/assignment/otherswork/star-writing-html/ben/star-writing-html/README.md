# README

This document contains some basic instructions for how to interact with this project

## The actual files of value
The files that will be worked on are still located in starter files folder.  Please check there.  

Also, as per Doug's instructions, gifs have been downloaded, moved to the (created) images folder (again, in starter files) and relative links have been used.  Downloading the gifs was more of a pain than expected.  Attempting to downloading from giphy directly attempts to download a .webp container file.  Workarounds (to download gifs) were used.
