Your task is to review index.png and index.html and to write the CSS to match the mockup listed below.

Getting Started

Inside, you'll find a resources folder and a starter_files folder. The resources folder contains the screenshot of the final HTML page, but you can just use the one below.

The starter_files folder contains the starter HTML file, the img folder (containing all of the images for the page), and a blank CSS file. The CSS file is already linked up to the HTML file, so you can go ahead and code away with your styles.
