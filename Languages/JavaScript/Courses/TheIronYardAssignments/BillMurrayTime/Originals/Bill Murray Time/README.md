# README

This document contains some basic instructions for how to interact with this project

## Solution Files
Solutions to the coding challenges are included with this activity.

Do not look at the completed code solutions, before you have attempted to code the HTML. Once you've gotten the code as far as you can, use the solution files to compare and contrast with your own work.

Note the structure of the solution code. Try to evaluate the ways your decisions differ from the solution code.

## Resources
The resources folder contains files designed to help you complete the activity. This will include screen shots of the completed HTML and files containing the text.

### Screen Shots
Screen shot of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work to try and determine if you are on track.

### Text Files
Additionally, the text for each page is provided so that you don't have to type it word by word from the screen shots. Some pages may include images. URLs for the images are provided to be used as the source attribute on the image.
