# Activity: Bill Murray Time - Practice with HTML - Pair Programming

## Objectives  
Work with your peers to convert the provided text into valid HTML pages.

## Steps  
During this activity:

* Evaluate the text files and review the screenshots of both pages.
* The screenshots can be found in the resources folder as table.png and index.png.
* Discuss how best to markup the elements to create a valid HTML document.
* Edit the starter HTML files and view them in your browser.
* Continue editing until your content looks like the screenshots.

Stop frequently to compare and contrast your approaches to coding the two HTML pages.

## Getting Started  
Read the enclosed README.md file for more details.

This activity includes starter files for the two HTML pages, index.html and table.html. Download the following source folder and unpack it. In the unzipped folder, you will find the starter files, assets, and completed code. Do not look at the solution code until your team has marked up the HTML pages! This is a group project, help one another as much as needed.

NOTE: the index page has Bill's name as a link. Make that link to either Bill's wikipedia page, or to the table.html file.

## Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
