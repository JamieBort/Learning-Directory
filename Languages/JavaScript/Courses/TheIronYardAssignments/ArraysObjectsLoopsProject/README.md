# Arrays, Objects, and Loops Project

This project assesses your basic understanding of object and array manipulation. It also includes looping and iteration. Take your time and carefully read the instructions that accompany each task.

## Instructions  

In this project, your task is to complete the unfinished functions. Instructions accompany each function explaining what the function should do and what value it should return. You will implement logic using loops, conditional statements, arrays, and objects to return the values specified in the instructions.

All of the function tasks can be found in `script.js`.

The `test.js` file contains tests for all of the functions in this project. Do not change any code in `test.js`. To see the output from `test.js` and to evaluate your work, open `index.html` in Chrome and view the console in the Developer Tools. You'll know that you are finding success when all of the `console.log` statements print 'true'.
