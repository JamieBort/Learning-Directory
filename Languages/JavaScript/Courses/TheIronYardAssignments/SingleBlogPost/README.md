# Activity: Single Blog Post - Pair Programming
Start by downloading the `starter_files` zip and open up the files in your text editor. Inside you'll find the following:

* `index.html`
* `main.js`
* `styles.css`
At the top of your `main.js` file, you'll find some blog post information. Inject this information into the `.container` element in your `index.html` file.

The final HTML should look like the following:
```<article>
  <h2>The Amazing Sloth</h2>
  <div class="meta">
    <span class="date">Written on May 2, 2017</span>
  </div>
  <div class="post">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/MC_Drei-Finger-Faultier.jpg">
    Sloths make very good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to several species of moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.*
  </div>
  <div class="site">

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
