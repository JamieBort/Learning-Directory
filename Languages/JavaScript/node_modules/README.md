# Node Modules

node_modules/ directories should not be uploaded to git repositories.

To that end, note that these lines 

```
# exempt the /Git/node_modules/ directory
!/Git/node_modules/
```

are in the file so that `this` /Git/node_modules/ directory is tracked by Git.

TODO: Figure out why Prettier has an issue with this file. I suspect that it has to do with the face that a markdown file (this one) is in a directory with the name node_modules/.
