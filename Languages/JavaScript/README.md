# JavaScript

This directory houses all the JavaScript courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

I am in the process of moving some files and directories from [this repo](https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeChallenges) into this directory.

When done, this directory should have ONLY the following directories in it:

1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

as defined in this [Explanation of files and directories](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory#explanation-of-files-and-directories) section; and this readme file.

There are also 4. `Frameworks` 5. `Libraries` and 6. `Testing`

`JavaScript`, and `scratch` are temporary.

## Resources

- jq

  - from https://jqlang.github.io/jq/

    > `jq` is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that `sed`, `awk`, `grep` and friends let you play with text.

  - from https://github.com/jqlang/jq

    > jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor akin to `sed`,`awk`,`grep`, and friends for JSON data. It's written in portable C and has zero runtime dependencies, allowing you to easily slice, filter, map, and transform structured data.
