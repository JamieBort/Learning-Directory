// A Hand class will need to contain cards just like the Deck class does. It will also be assigned a value by the rules of the game based on which cards it contains. Since the dealer's hand should only display one card, we also keep track of whether the Hand belongs to the dealer to accommodate this rule.
public class Hand {
    // instantiate variables -maybe our 52 unique cards

    Hand() { // constructor
    }

    static void printMe(){
        System.out.println("inside Hand.java");
