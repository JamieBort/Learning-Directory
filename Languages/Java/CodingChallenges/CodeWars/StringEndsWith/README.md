Solved. But Attempt02.java needs to be cleaned up a bit. Also, the code could be refined...

Just started.

## Problem Statement

Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

Example:
```
solution('abc', 'bc') // returns true
solution('abc', 'd') // returns false
```
