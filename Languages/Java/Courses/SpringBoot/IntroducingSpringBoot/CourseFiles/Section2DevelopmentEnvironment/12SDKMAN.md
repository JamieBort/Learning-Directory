Following the instructions in the [video 12](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-getting-started/learn/lecture/4538866#overview) I went to this page: https://sdkman.io/install
 Following the instructions on that page I ran these commands in Terminal
 1. `curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`
 2. and then `source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`
 3. and then `sdk version`

 All went well.

 Next used sdkman to install groovy, gradle, and spring boot.
