# Java Programming Masterclass for Software Developers

**This course was started on my work laptop. I had to purge the files however. So some of the exercises may be missing.**

## Next Steps
1. Go back and work on the challenges that I have **not completed**. And then the ones that I have **not started**.
2. Start looking into the implementation of the database in this course - can I start working on it? Or do I need to follow the course sequentially?
3. Continue to take notes on the videos.
