# Java

This directory houses all the Java courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

I am in the process of moving some files and directories from [this repo](https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeChallenges) into this directory.

When done, this directory should have ONLY the following directies in it, plus this readme file:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

Note: Added the `Java_Specific_Concepts` directory to work on Packages.

## Courses
Udemy courses and the like.
Tutorials.

## Coding Challenges
Exercises from sites such as CodeWars.com

### Projects
I don't think this should be in here any more. But will leave it for now.

## Java_Specific_Concepts

## Directories and Files

### Directories

### Files

* java_version_notes.md - This file is to understand my java environment on my machine. And to have a clean install of only one java version. By removing all the current versions and starting clean.
