### homebrew files

source: https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3

> [If Homebrew is successfully installed, there will be Homebrew files in `/usr/local/bin` (for macOS Intel) or `/opt/homebrew` (for Apple Silicon).](<https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/3#:~:text=If%20Homebrew%20is%20successfully%20installed,homebrew%20(for%20Apple%20Silicon).>)

Location of my homebrew files:

~~**Note**, my Homebrew files are **not** located in `usr/local/bin` but rather in `usr/local/Homebrew`.~~

Never mind. They're in `usr/local/bin` and I think they get pointed to `usr/local/Homebrew`.

```
jamiebort@MacBook-Pro:/$ ls -al usr/local/bin/brew
lrwxr-xr-x  1 jamiebort  admin    28B Nov 15  2016 usr/local/bin/brew@ -> /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew
```
