Chmod 000 file2.txt
--------- 1 robert robert 33 Sep 21 10:32 file1.txt
Sudo chmod ugo+rwx file1.txt

If 
-rw-r--r--. 1 cmason root 0 feb 27 12:15
, the first dash means it's a file. If it's a d, it's a directory.

What group? Root.
Who's the owner? Cmason
What's in the file? Nothing, since it's 0
What permissions are granted to others? Read only
Which command would you use to grant the user and group executable permission for file1? Chmod

  sudo chmod g+w exec.sh 
Sudo Changemode Group plus write

Don't use chmod 777, that's bad practice unless they need them

Always use least permissions

__

711 means 
user can read,write,execute
Group can execute
Others can execute

__

Only grant more permissions as the need arises.
__

Use alphanumeric chars, dots, and dashes, nothing else.
__

Ps
-e every process
-f is longer list


Ps aux --sort -rss displays the processes in order from highest to lowest memory

Ps aux --sort pid sorts by smallest PID to highest PID

Pstree shows a tree diagram of all of the parent and child processes.

Pstree -p shows all of that, plus the PID of each process next to it

Top lists processes by cpu use

Kill command explicitly ends processes, usually when the process fails to quit on its own.
  if the parent process is killed, USUALLY kills the child processes but not always
  -9 signal immediately kills without  a graceful exit
 -15 signal gracefully kills the process
	You might need to use 9 after 15, but you should try 15 first.
	Recommended to be in root when you do this


Addtl kill commands

SIGHUP value of 1 hangup
SIGINT value of 2 interrupt from keyboard (ctrl-c)
SIGKILL value of 9 kill signal
SIGTERM value of 15 termination signal
SIGSTOP value of stop the process
Nice and renice commands:
 launch process with nice <-value> <cmd> to start at a given priority
 smallest number, highest priority.


____

Jobs are processes started and managed by regular users

Move jobs to foregroud with fg %jobnumber
Must suspend the job with ctrl+Z first
Move jobs to background with bg %jobnumber

Schedule tasks with the at and cron commands

At command runs a task once, at a specific time
   used for one-time tasks like running a backup script today.
Chron daemon runs a task on a regular basis, at a specific time
   used for repetitive tasks


____


Ssh used to securely connect to remote server or system.
   user_name@host(IP/Hostname_name)
  ssh user01#computer42

Systemctl <subcommand> <service name>  BE CAREFUL. You can manage services with this. Don't stop a service you're using, and don't disable a service your computer needs.

Lscpu: shows cpu information
Dmidecode: shows system hardware information

Vmstat: use of virtual memory
Free: use of physical memory
Ip addr show

Nice goes from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority

Nslookup finds ip address of business or website.

Traceroute <ip address>

Ssh stands for secure shell

Ssh daemon executes commands at command line as though you were in your own computer.
