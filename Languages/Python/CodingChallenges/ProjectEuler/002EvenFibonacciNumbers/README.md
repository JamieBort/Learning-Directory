### Status

~~Successfully submitted `4613732` which was produced from `attempt03.js`.~~

~~With attempt02.js I think I have the correct solution.
But when I test my answer with the website I'm told it's not correct.~~

### Research

~~[Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers](https://medium.com/@TheZaki/project-euler-2-even-fibonacci-numbers-2219e9438970) Medium blog post.~~

### Problem Statement

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```

#### [attempt01.py](./attempt01.py)

Works for test case where we have 10 terms.

Not getting a result for 4,000,000 terms.

After consulting [Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers Medium blog post.](https://github.com/JamieBort/Learning-Directory/tree/coding-challenges/Languages/JavaScript/CodingChallenges/ProjectEuler/002EvenFibonacciNumbers#research) (from my previous research) (see `def even_fibonacci_sum(n):`), I am on to something.

Maybe consult another resource online.
