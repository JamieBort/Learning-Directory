# Python Coding Challenges

This directory houses all the Python coding challenges I have started and completed.

Each sub-directory is the name of a coding challenge website.

See 'Online Games' from this [Career To-Dos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-FDmLzGuYkasZpv9A1gTEV396rtWAi1bnCDh2uE7Q0/edit#) Google Drive document for more code challenge website ideas.
