# NodePractice

Uses `express` and `path`.

This should be moved to `https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Servers/Node`.

Originally this was it's own repo found here: https://github.com/JamieBort/NodePractice

However after this is moved that repo will be deleted.

## To run.

In `NodePractice/` run nodemon `trivial-app.js`.

Then navigate to `index.html` in a browser.

`Image 1`, `Image 2`, and `Image 3` will be served without receiving an error.
