Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> =

1 + 4 + ... + 100 =

385 .


The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> =

55<sup>2</sup> =

3025 .


Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
