**Reverse Polish Calculator**

Use an array as a stack for a Reverse Polish Notation calclator

For this activity implement a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.

See the [Reverse Polish notation wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for a better understanding of RPN.

See the [Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Example) to understand the algorithm.

**Getting Started**

Open up a new project in IntelliJ. Create a Main class with a main() method if IntelliJ did not do it for you.

**Assignment**

Code the algorithm that is described in the Example of the wiki.

See the starting file for some clues.

**Hints**

What is "the stack"? The term stack refers to a way of storing/ordering data. You can think of it like a stack of papers/folders. In this assignment you'll only need to interact with the top of the stack: taking items off the top of the stack, doing some calculation, and then putting items back on top of the stack. As you read through the example, you can see that they keep track of what's on the stack. The leftmost number is the "top" of the stack.

**Extras**

1. Create a another file Bubble. Write the algorithm to bubble sort an array of ints. Test it in the Main class.

2. Create a another file Bubble. Write the algorithm to bubble sort an array of Strings. Test it in the Main class.
