/**
 * Follow the instructions in the javadoc comments below to complete the to-do
 * tasks listed below. You can run all tests by selecting and executing the
 * "Run all tests (ArithmeticOperatorsTest)" run configuration.
 * <p>
 * This exercise is focused on learning how to work with arithmetic operators
 * and different types of data in Java. Specifically, you should pay attention
 * to how different types of data work together. For example, if you divide an
 * integer by a double, what type of data do you get back? Also, pay attention
 * to the fact that all of the expressions you will write follow the same
 * pattern. If you recognize the patterns you can begin to make inferences about
 * how to write your own code and how other code works.
 * <p>
 * For each of the methods listed below, you will use System.out.println() to
 * print the output from a particular expression. For example, if you are asked
 * to add an integer and a double your method body might look like this:
 * <p>
 * <code>System.out.println(123 + 5.12);</code>
 * <p>
 * As with other exercises, don't write more than one line of code at a time!
 * Write a line, test it. If there's a problem, fix it then and there. Once
 * that's working it's safe to move on to the next problem. But, if you try to
 * write or change more than one thing at a time, it can be hard to know what
 * impact your changes are having. For example, if you make a bunch of changes
 * and then your program stops working correctly, how do you know which of those
 * changes introduced the problem? By moving slowly and methodically you will be
 * a faster and better programmer.
