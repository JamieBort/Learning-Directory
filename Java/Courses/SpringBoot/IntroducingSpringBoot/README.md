## Status

### Section 1 Introduction
All of it should be watched again.

### Section 2 Development Environment

Didn't watch videos 7, 9, 10, 11, nor 13. They deal with Windows.

Watched videos 6, 8, and 12.

Video 6 was the introduction to this section.

Video 8 is for installing Java.

[Video 12](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-getting-started/learn/lecture/4538866#overview) is on SDKMAN. 
More on sdk man found here:
https://hackernoon.com/using-sdkman-to-manage-java-versions-7fde0d38c501
In this video we installed Spring Boot, Groovy, and Gradle.

Video 14 was for installing IntelliJ IDEA.
The instructor omitted the fact that the Spring Initializr plugin wasn't an option for the community version of V. S. Code. 
So I need to use: 
https://start.spring.io/ to create/start the project.
To that end I found these tutorials:
1. https://medium.com/danielpadua/java-spring-boot-intellij-idea-b919b0097a0
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mpHejytgFE

To be continued...

### Section 3 Hello, Spring Boot
Video 15 was a 1 minute intro to this section.

Video 16 covered how to write a Spring Boot app from scratch. Come back to this video to understand better what is going on. And take notes in [this README](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Java/Courses/SpringBoot/IntroducingSpringBoot/CourseFiles/Section3HelloSpringBoot/16HelloWorldCreatingYourFirstSpringBootApplication/README.md) file.

Video 17 is an exercise that I didn't start yet.

Video 18 covers creating a Spring Boot app using Spring Initializr. As well as generating a Spring Boot app via the CLI. See [the README](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Java/Courses/SpringBoot/IntroducingSpringBoot/CourseFiles/Section3HelloSpringBoot/18SpringInitializr/README.md) file for notes taken.
