### Section 1 Introduction
All of it should be watched again.

### Section 2 Development Environment

Didn't watch videos 7, 9, 10, 11, nor 13. They deal with Windows.

Watched videos 6, 8, and 12.

Video 6 was the introduction to this section.

Video 8 is for installing Java.

[Video 12](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-getting-started/learn/lecture/4538866#overview) is on SDKMAN. 
More on sdk man found here:

In this video we installed Spring Boot, Groovy, and Gradle.

Video 14 was for installing IntelliJ IDEA.
The instructor omitted the fact that the Spring Initializr plugin wasn't an option for the community version of V. S. Code. 
So I need to use: 
https://start.spring.io/ to create/start the project.
To that end I found these tutorials:

Video 17 is an exercise that I didn't start yet.

See [the README](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Java/Courses/SpringBoot/IntroducingSpringBoot/CourseFiles/Section3HelloSpringBoot/18SpringInitializr/README.md) file for notes taken.
