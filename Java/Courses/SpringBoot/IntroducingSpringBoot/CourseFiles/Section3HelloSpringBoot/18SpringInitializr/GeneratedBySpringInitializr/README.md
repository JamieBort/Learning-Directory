# README demo in GeneratedBySpringInitializr

This zip file was generated by me using the website https://start.spring.io/ following the instructor's instrucitons.

After unzipping the zipped file (by running `unzip demo.zip` in terminal) the directory `demo/` was produced.

Note: navigated to [this demo/](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Java/Courses/SpringBoot/IntroducingSpringBoot/CourseFiles/Section3HelloSpringBoot/18SpringInitializr/GeneratedBySpringInitializr/demo/src/main/java/com/example/demo) directory in Terminal. Then ran `spring run DemoApplication.java`.
The following was the error/response. Might be a result of using the `Spring Data JPA` dependancy. Will table this for now. And move on with the lesson.
