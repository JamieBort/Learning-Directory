Notes.

Come back to video 16 to take notes about explained_app.groovy file. He explained some things that I need to come back to at a later date.

app.groovy was typed out - it wasn't generated by a CLI, Spring Initializr, or anywhere else.

Once app.groovy was writen, using Terminal I navigated to the directory that it was in and ran this `spring run app.groovy`.

This was some of the output: `Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)` which told me that I coud navigate to `localhost: 8080` in a browser to see "Hello, World!" from line 5 of app.groovy.

That's it. A Spring Boot app was created.

At 3:57 he starts to explain some more of what is going on. Come back to this video to understand it better later on.
