## Section 9 - Inner and Abstract Classes & Interfaces
Section09InnerAndAbstractClassesAndInterfaces

### 123 - Interfaces
* Interfaces specifiy methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement.
* In other words, if a class implements an interface, then the methods in that interface must be implemented by that class.
* it's abstract - no code (logic?) is writen. only the methods
* forces common behavior among all the classes that implement the interface.
* on other words standardize way a set of classes is used
* in the body of the interface function signatures are writen, but not the logic - that is left up to each class the implements the interface.
* access modifiers are not needed in the function signatures of interfaces.
* **use** `implements` keyword, **not** `extends` keyword.

**Need to look this up!!!!**

Notice the `Random_Class` and `An_Interface` methods in the [Section09Methods.java](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Java/Courses/JavaProgrammingMasterclassForSoftwareDevelopers/CourseFiles/Section09InnerAndAbstractClassesAndInterfaces/Section09Methods.java) file.

On line 10 is `RandomClass randomClass = new RandomClass();`.

On line 20 is `AnInterface anInterface = new RandomClass();`. 

But the result seems to be teh same. What's the difference? Does it matter?
