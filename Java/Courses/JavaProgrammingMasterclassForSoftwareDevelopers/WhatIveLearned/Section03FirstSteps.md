Statement - It can include one or more expressions and we'll be talking about expressions and a related topic operators later in the course.

### 22 - Hello World Challenge and Common Errors
String literal
Challenge. Too simple to complete.

### 23 - Variables
Variables
int
expressions - "what is after the equals sign". A construct that evaluates to a single value.

### 24 - Starting out with Expressions

### 25 - Primitive Types
Primitive Data Types

Eight primitive types
* boolean
* byte
* char
* short
* int
* long
* float
* double

Wrapper class
* int -> Integer

overflow

underflow

### 26 - byte, short, long and width

### 27 - Casting in Java

### 28 - Primitive Types Challenge
Challenge - not done yet. I'm getting a negative number. Not able to get a negative number again. Has something to do with casting, autoboxing, or the like.

### 29 - float and double Primitive Types
float_and_double_Primitive_Types_29
Watched. See files for notes.

### 30 - Floating Point Precision and a Challenge
Floating_Point_Precision_and_a_Challenge_30
30FloatingPointPrecisionAndAChallenge

* Float is single precision number.
* Double is double precision number.
* Double is more precise than float.
* Double takes twice the space as a float.
* Double is faster than float.
* Java will look at a floating point number and assume it's a double if the number isn't explicitly named as a float when the variable is assigned. Even if it's instantiated as a float.
* Java libraries are often written to return doubles rather than floats.
* Underscores are ignored in digits: 3_456_123_455.328_271 is read as 3456123455.328271
* When more precision is needed than float and double can give, BigDecimal object is needed.
