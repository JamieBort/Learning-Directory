Composition91/
~~Composition_91.java~~

* Car is a vehicle ( because it extends from vehicle ) inheritance relationship
* `inheritance relationship`/`extends`/`is a`

* `composition relationship`/`?`/`has a`
* composition relationship has a
model parts of the greater whole
a computer has a monitor
a computer has a mouse
a computer has a keyboard

Notes started - need to be cleaned up.
Also, not done taking notes.

### 93 - Encapuslation
Encapuslation93/
* Mechanism protects members from external access.
* `private` keyword vs `public` keyword
* also need to use `getters` and `setters`.
* put validation in constructor to make sure fields are assigned properly and as expected.
* field names can be changed without effecting the classes that use this encapsulated class, so long as the methods names in this class are not changed.

### 95 - Polymorphism
Polymorphism95/
* "mechanism allows actions to act differently based on the actual object that the action is being performed on"
* associated with the `@Override` keyword
* In this lesson we have (see: `/LearningDirectory/Java/Courses/JavaProgrammingMasterclassForSoftwareDevelopers/CourseFiles/Section07OOPPart2CompositionEncapulationAndPolymorphism/Polymorphism95/`):
    * a Movie class with a `plot()` method
    * five other classes that extend `Movie`
        * four of these also have a `plot()` method.
