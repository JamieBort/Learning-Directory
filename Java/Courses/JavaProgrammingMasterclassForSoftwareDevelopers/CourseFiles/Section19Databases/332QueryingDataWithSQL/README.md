# 332 Querying Data With SQL

The second supplied "file" was actually this link: https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html

Commands I am running for [this section](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/learn/lecture/6060828#overview) of the course.

First obtained the zipped music file from the supplied files [here](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Java/Courses/JavaProgrammingMasterclassForSoftwareDevelopers/SuppliedFiles/Section19Databases/332QueryingDataWithSQL/music.zip).

Then navigated to the location of the music file:
`cd Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/LearningDirectory/Java/Courses/JavaProgrammingMasterclassForSoftwareDevelopers/CourseFiles/Section19Databases/332QueryingDataWithSQL/`

`sqlite3 music.db`

Result:
```
jamiebort@My-MacBook-Pro-3:~/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/LearningDirectory/Java/Courses/JavaProgrammingMasterclassForSoftwareDevelopers/CourseFiles/Section19Databases/332QueryingDataWithSQL$ sqlite3 music.db
SQLite version 3.13.0 2016-05-18 10:57:30
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
```
So it worked.
