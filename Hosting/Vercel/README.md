You can manually deploy from other branches by

- going to the [Deployments](https://vercel.com/jamie-borts-projects/jamiebort-github-io/deployments) tab,

- selecting the three dots,

- selecting `Create Deployment`,

- and then paste in the **Git commit** that I want to have deployed; not necessarily the one from my master branch.
