# Web Components

The purpose of this directory is to learn about Web Components.

Just started learning about Web Components. This directory might be better suited to be in a `HTML` directory. Or a `JavaScript` directory. Or a third directory. Or not at all.

`ReusableComponentsTutorial` was created first.

`MyReusableComponent` to practice what I learned in "ReusableComponentsTutorial".
