# Python

The purpose of this directory is to house all the code I write as I learn Python and hone my Python skills.
This is to help keep my GitHub account organized.


This directory houses all the Python courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

This directory should have ONLY the following directies in it:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

as defined in this [Explanation of files and directories](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory#explanation-of-files-and-directories) section; and this readme file.
