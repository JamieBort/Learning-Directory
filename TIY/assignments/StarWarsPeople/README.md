# Activity: Star Wars People - Pair Programming

In this activity, let's make an Ajax request to the [Star Wars API.](https://swapi.co/)
  We will keep things simple, by making our request to the endpoint of /people, which will return a list of 10 of the main characters. Upon receiving that data, we'll just append them to a `<ul>` element on our page inside of an `<li>` for each person. Inside of the `<li>`, you just need to put their name but feel free to work with more of the data if you'd like.

You'll use this URL to retrieve the data - [http://swapi.co/api/people/](http://swapi.co/api/people/)

## Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.

========================

Comments: I played around with these files to get a better idea of how APIs work. To that end I also used Postman. I learned some but feel I need to play around with other APIs and files and maybe revisit this API and these files before I get a better grasp of them.
