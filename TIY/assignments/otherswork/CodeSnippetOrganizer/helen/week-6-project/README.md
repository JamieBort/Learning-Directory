/* objectives
Using Express and Mongoose, create an application that organizes code snippets that you save for later use.

At a minimum, snippets should have:

a title

optional notes
a language
tags -- that is, user-defined words or phrases that classify the code, like "authentication", "front-end", "middleware", or "database".
Your application must:

have a comprehensive set of tests for all controllers and models
have registration and login
allow you to create a snippet
allow you to see a list of all your snippets
allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific language
allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific tag
allow you to look at an individual snippet
have an API to allow for creating and viewing of snippets as listed above */
