# Build a JavaScript Calculator  

* This project will help you understand how to use JavaScript functions and algorithms. 
* You will also work with the DOM and respond to user input.

**Step 1: Set up your project**

* Create an index.html file
* Create a main.css file and link it to your index.html file
* Create a main.js file and link it to your index.html file

**Step 2: Build the HTML**
* Using the mockup provided below, create your HTML

**Step 3: Apply the Styles**
* Author CSS to match your HTML page to the mockup

**Step 4: Write the JavaScript**
* Writing the JavaScript and interacting with the DOM is the main part of the project
* Start small by selecting some elements
* What algorithms do you need to implement?
* Create some functions to store repeatable steps
* You'll need to find a way to track the numbers pressed until the = is pressed

## Hard Mode  
* Chain complex calculations.
    * Ex: 5 + 5 - 4 / 10
    * Take into account order of operation
    * You'll need a way to manage state if you do this
* Add a button to calculate the Modulo of 2 numbers
* Add a button to calculate the Square Root of 2 numbers
* Add a decimal button
* Keep track of all the calculations so that you can scroll back through them
