**Math Operations**

Input two numbers, do some math and out the results

For this activity you will be combining user input, console output, variables that reference String and double data types and math operations.

**Getting Started**

Open up a new project in IntelliJ. Either have IntelliJ generate a Main.java file with a public static void main(String[] args) method by choosing the Command Line App template or create it yourself.

**Assignment**

In the main method of Main.java class:

* Ask the user to input two numbers
* Get the numbers as Strings using Scanner
* Convert a String to a double using [Double.parseDouble](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#parseDouble-java.lang.String-). Save the the first double value in an operand1 variable and the second double value in an operand2 variable
* Add the operands and save in a sum variable
* Subtract the operands and save in a difference variable
* Divide the operands and save in a division variable
* Multiple the operands and save in a multiplication variable
* Find the remainder when one operand is divided by the other and save in a remainder variable. See [this page](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op1.html) if you need to learn more about the remainder operator.
* Call a showResults method and pass the sum, difference, division, multiplication and remainder variables as arguments.
* In the showResults method output the parameters with some meaningful text (e.g. The sum is 10.5).

**Extras**  
Try some of the other Java operators which can be found at [Operators](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html)
