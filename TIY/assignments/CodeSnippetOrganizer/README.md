**Code Snippet Organizer**
Build an organizer for holding your and others' code snippets.

Using Express and Mongoose, create an application that organizes code snippets that you save for later use.

At a minimum, snippets should have:

* a title
* a body (the code)
* optional notes
* a language
* tags -- that is, user-defined words or phrases that classify the code, like "authentication", "front-end", "middleware", or "database".

Your application must:

* have a comprehensive set of tests for all controllers and models
* have registration and login
* allow you to create a snippet
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific language
* allow you to see a list of all your snippets for a specific tag
* allow you to look at an individual snippet
* have an API to allow for creating and viewing of snippets as listed above


**Advanced activities**

Optimally, your snippet organizer should let people not only look at their own snippets, but also look at others' snippets. If you get to this part, your application should:

* allow you to view just your own snippets or others'
* allow you to view all snippets for another person
* allow you to view all snippets site-wide for a specific language
* allow you to view all snippets site-wide for a specific tag
* allow you to "star" or favorite other people's snippets
* allow you to sort snippets by date created or updated, and by number of stars
