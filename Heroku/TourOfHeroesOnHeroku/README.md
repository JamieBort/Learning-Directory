# README Tour Of Heroes On Heroku

[Deploy the angular “Tour of heroes” tutorial on Heroku](https://trello.com/c/dxi8F2so/232-deploy-the-angular-tour-of-heroes-tutorial-on-heroku) Trello card associated with this directory.

The [Tour Of Heroes On Heroku](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Heroku/TourOfHeroesOnHeroku) directory in the GitHub repo.

Two things of note.
1. This tutorial follows in the footsteps of [this one](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Angular/TourOfHerosAngularTutorial).
2. This tutorial mentions 
 a. tests and
 b. substituting angular cli for raw WebPack to build the application
 
 I am going to forego these both of these for now in an effort to accomplish the task of deploying this app successfully on Heroku. Then, if I need to or want to I can circle back around to understand both of those better.
