# README Tour Of Heroes On Heroku

## Status

Running into issues. Going to pause here and look at different tutorials.

Two things of note.
1. This tutorial follows in the footsteps of [this one](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Angular/TourOfHerosAngularTutorial).
2. This tutorial mentions
    1. tests and
    2. substituting angular cli for raw WebPack to build the application

I am going to forego these both of these for now in an effort to accomplish the task of deploying this app successfully on Heroku. Then, if I need to or want to I can circle back around to understand both of those better.
