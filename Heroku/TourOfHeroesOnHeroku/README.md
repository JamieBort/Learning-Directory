# README Tour Of Heroes On Heroku

[Deploy the angular “Tour of heroes” tutorial on Heroku](https://trello.com/c/dxi8F2so/232-deploy-the-angular-tour-of-heroes-tutorial-on-heroku) Trello card associated with this directory.

Two things of note.
1. This tutorial follows in the footsteps of [this one](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Angular/TourOfHerosAngularTutorial).
2. This tutorial mentions tests. I am going to forego these tests for now. And focus on getting the app to work in Heroku. Then I can circle back around to understand testing better.
