Notes for authenticating. Associated with the second video.

### What have I learned so far
How to authenticate using Postman.

What I know so that I can retrace my steps.

Outside of any repository I've saved certain authentication strings, such as keys and tokens in this `/DevFiles/KeysTokens` directory.

For example, (for the moment) the Google Calendar authentication strings are in the  `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/GoogleCalendarCredientials/` directory. And the Trello authentication strings `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/TrelloKeyToken.txt` file.

I then followed this [Intro to Postman Part 2: authorizing a request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q23wkkfezfM&list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ&index=3&t=0s) YouTube video; which is from this [Intro To Postman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ) YouTube video series on Postman.
