### What have I learned so far
Making API calls using Postman.

What I know so that I can retrace my steps.

Below are comments on authenticating.

~~Outside of any repository I've saved certain authentication strings, such as keys and tokens in this `/DevFiles/KeysTokens` directory.~~

(For the moment) the Google Calendar authentication strings are in the  `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/GoogleCalendarCredientials/` directory. And the Trello authentication strings `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/TrelloKeyToken.txt` file.

I then followed this [Intro to Postman Part 1: sending a request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E60ZttwIpY&list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ&index=1) YouTube video. It's part of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q23wkkfezfM&list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ&index=2 YouTube video series on Postman.


The below are used for authenticating, I didn't use them here.
