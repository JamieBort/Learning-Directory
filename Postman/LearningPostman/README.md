# README LearningPostman

The purpose of this directory is for learning to use Postman.

### Status
Started watching the [Intro To Postman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ) YouTube series.

Started documenting here what I've done to learn how to authenticate with Postman.

### Next Steps
Come back and finish documenting here what I've done to learn how to authenticate with Postman.

### What have I learned so far
What I know so that I can retrace my steps.

Outside of any repository I've saved certain authentication strings, such as keys and tokens in this `/DevFiles/KeysTokens` directory.

(For the moment) the Google Calendar authentication strings are in the  `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/GoogleCalendarCredientials/` directory. And the Trello authentication strings `/DevFiles/KeysTokens/TrelloKeyToken.txt` file.

I've then followed the first two videos of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q23wkkfezfM&list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ&index=2 YouTube video series to make authenticated api calls in Postman.

Also used this:

And this:
https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/#your-first-api-call

And this:

Maybe this too:
