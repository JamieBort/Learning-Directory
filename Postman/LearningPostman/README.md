# LearningPostman

The purpose of this directory is for learning to use Postman.

### Status
Started watching the [Intro To Postman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM-7VG-sgbtAgGq_pef5y_ruIUBPpUgNJ) YouTube series.

Started documenting here what I've done to learn how to authenticate with Postman.

### Next Steps
Come back and finish documenting here what I've done to learn how to authenticate with Postman.

Also, consider createing a new section for authentication and putting [this](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/Postman/LearningPostman#what-have-i-learned-so-far) "How to authenticate." info there.
