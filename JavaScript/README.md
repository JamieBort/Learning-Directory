# README JavaScript

This directory houses all the JavaScript courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

I am in the process of moving some files and directories from [this repo](https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeChallenges) into this directory.

When done, this directory should have ONLY the following directies in it, plus this readme file:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`
