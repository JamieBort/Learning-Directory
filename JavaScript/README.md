# JavaScript

This directory houses all the JavaScript courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

I am in the process of moving some files and directories from [this repo](https://github.com/JamieBort/CodeChallenges) into this directory.

When done, this directory should have ONLY the following directies in it:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

as defined in this [Explanation of files and directories](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory#explanation-of-files-and-directories) section; and this readme file.

There are also `Frameworks`, `JavaScript`, and `scratch` directories.

## Courses
Udemy courses and the like. Tutorials.

## Coding Challenges
Exercises from sites such as CodeWars.com

## Projects

## JavaScript Specific Concepts
A directory to house files and directories used to learn these specific concepts.

## Libraries
Libraries such as Redux or D3 that I am trying to lear using.
