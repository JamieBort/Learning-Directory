## Status
This one is now behind a paywall.
And I think AlphabetSoup.js already solved this one.
~~But I will attempt to solve it anyay.~~
Solved - I think. I cannot verify with their site.

## Challenge
Using the JavaScript language, have the function AlphabetSoup(str) take the str string parameter being passed and return the string with the letters in alphabetical order (ie. hello becomes ehllo). Assume numbers and punctuation symbols will not be included in the string.
