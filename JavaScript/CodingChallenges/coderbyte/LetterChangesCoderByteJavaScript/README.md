## Status
This one is now behind a paywall.
~~And I think AlphabetSoup.js already solved this one.~~
~~But I will attempt to solve it anyay.~~
~~Solved - I think. See attempt01.js ~~
~~I cannot verify with their site.~~

## Challenge
Using the JavaScript language, have the function LetterChanges(str) take the str parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.
