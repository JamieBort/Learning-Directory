# CodeWars

File naming convention.

~~Discussion forum found here:

01miscellaneous_challenges/ contains two directories each containing files that I think Josh and I created to pair program.

I think using CodeWars.

I think that there are two directories because the file names are duplicated; possibly because they're identical files.
