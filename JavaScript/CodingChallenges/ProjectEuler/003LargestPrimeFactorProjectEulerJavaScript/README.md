## Prime Factorization Method

Division Method
The steps to calculate the prime factors of a number is similar to the process of finding the factors of a large number. Follow the below steps to find the prime factors of a number using the division method:

Step 1: Divide the given number by the smallest prime number. In this case, the smallest prime number should divide the number exactly.
Step 2: Again, divide the quotient by the smallest prime number.
Step 3: Repeat the process, until the quotient becomes 1.
Step 4: Finally, multiply all the prime factors
