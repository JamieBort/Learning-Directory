## Problem 4

Problem statement:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Completed the challenge.

Ways to improve the code below:
Minimize the number of 'if' statements below.
Remove line 36.
Generalize 'arrayProduct[i].toString().length' so that the code can be used for palindromes made from the product of an two digits of any length. 
Refactor in other way - look for them.
