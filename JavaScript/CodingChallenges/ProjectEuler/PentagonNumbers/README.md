Problem 44:

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

>1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?

## STATUS
PentagonNumbers.js wasn't working for me. It will work. But I need to spend more time with it.
StrictlyArrays.js was created as an alternative way to solve the problem.
I left off with StrictlyArrays.js.
