# Activity: CORS & Authentication - Round Table Discussion
# CORS & Authentication  
In this activity, create an index.html file and a main.js file and make a GET request to the following URL:

https://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~?format=json

This is using the LinkedIn API and will return a list of all of the people that you are connected to.

As you make your request, you'll notice that you will be presented with two separate errors. Spend time with your team discussing those errors and how you might solve them.

## Your role as a student
Take an active role in the conversation. Round table discussions are an opportunity to follow up on confusing ideas, to ask questions and to promote ideas. Don’t be afraid to ask about concepts that elude your or to talk through your understanding of particular concepts. Many of your peers will likely also have areas of struggle. Contribute and help where you can, seek peer guidance and explanation where you can’t.
