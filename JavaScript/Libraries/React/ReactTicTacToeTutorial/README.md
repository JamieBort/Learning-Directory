For `attempt02`, completed up through the [Declaring A Winner](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#declaring-a-winner) section.

I just created `attempt02`. Rather than reread what I wrote previously, I think starting fresh will be more productive.
Reading up on React Classes.

Before 20210425

`my-app` is my first attempt, attempt01 if you will.
I left off at the [Adding Time Travel](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel) section so that I could learn the fundamental comcepts from another tutorial before moving on with this one.

The `sideBySide` directory is superfluous - not part of the tutorial.
