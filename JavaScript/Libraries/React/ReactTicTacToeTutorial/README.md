# ReactTicTacToeTutorial

following this tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
which resulted in this directory:
LearningDirectory/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ReactTicTacToeTutorial/my-app

### Next Steps
a. Study what was done this morning. From the [Declaring A Winner](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#declaring-a-winner) section to the end.

b. Then, from the [Wrapping Up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) section do the following suggested tasks:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

### Status

20210426 afternoon

Finished the tutorial.

20210426 morning
For `attempt02`, completed up through the [Declaring A Winner](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#declaring-a-winner) section.

20210425

I just created `attempt02`. Rather than reread what I wrote previously, I think starting fresh will be more productive.
Reading up on React Classes.

Before 20210425

`my-app` is my first attempt, attempt01 if you will.
I left off at the [Adding Time Travel](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel) section so that I could learn the fundamental comcepts from another tutorial before moving on with this one.

The `sideBySide` directory is superfluous - not part of the tutorial.
