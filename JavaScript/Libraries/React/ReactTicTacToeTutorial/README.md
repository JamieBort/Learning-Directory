# ReactTicTacToeTutorial

following this tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
which resulted in this directory:
LearningDirectory/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ReactTicTacToeTutorial/my-app


### Status
I left off at the [Adding Time Travel](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel) section so that I could learn the fundamental comcepts from another tutorial before moving on with this one.

The `sideBySide` directory is superfluous - not part of the tutorial.
