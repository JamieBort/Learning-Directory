# 10 React Challenges (Beginner) Courses

**NOTE:** Rather than use the sandbox in these tutorials I have been creating my own environment in each directory using the `npx create-react-app my-app` command in the [Quick Overview](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#quick-overview) section of `Create React App` documentation.

## Status
* 01 Display Simple Data with JSX - Completed
Rather than use the sandbox in the tutorial I created my own environment in `01DisplaySimpleDataWithJSX`.
* 02LoopOverAndDisplayDataWithJSX
Completed the task. Styling is terrible. Code isn't cleaned up.
* 03UseReactStateToUpdateTheDOM
The files have been set up (in attempt01).
But haven't started anything yet.
