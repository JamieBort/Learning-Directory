### Status

`10 React Challenges (Beginner) Courses` has not been started yet.

`BuildYourOwnReact` has not been started yet.

`contacts-manager` was a great tutorial. It introduced `componentDidMount`, API calls, and the concept of adding components for each item that's returned by the api call.

`my-app` is done - it was created in preparation for `ReactTicTacToeTutorial`.

`ReactTicTacToeTutorial` is technically done. But there's more work to be done. 
See the [Next Step](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Libraries/React/ReactTicTacToeTutorial#next-steps) of the `ReactTicTacToeTutorial` directory.

`scratch` is created for practicing what I've learned/am learning from these tutorials.

`ShowHideCompent` is a tutorial I am following for learning how to show and hide components.
