This README file was created for my own notes. On account of the fact that the README.md file was auto-generated when I ran the command `npx create-react-app my-app`.

This directory and tutorial were created in preparation for this [LearningDirectory/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ReactTicTacToeTutorial](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ReactTicTacToeTutorial/my-app) turoial.

The following is from https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app.

It is good information.

See the following links for access to the links in the paragraphs - only the text is copied below.

[Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#gatsby)
>Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.

>When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.

[Next.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#nextjs)
>Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment.

>Learn Next.js from its official guide.

[Gatsby](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#gatsby)
>Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time.

>Learn Gatsby from its official guide and a gallery of starter kits.
