# README ShowHideComponent

Both [showhide](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ShowHideComponent/showhide) and [my_show_hide_app](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/JavaScript/Frameworks/React/ShowHideComponent/my_show_hide_app) were created using the [How to Show and Hide ReactJS Components](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-show-and-hide-reactjs-components) tutorial; ultimately for this this [TrelloAPI](https://github.com/JamieBort/TrelloAPI) project.

### The Status of `showhide`
Got the three Demo components to work by completing the [Hide or Show Component in React](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-show-and-hide-reactjs-components#module-hideorshowcomponentinreact) section.

### Next Steps for `showhide`
1. Read the code that I wrote so that I understand what is going on.

2. Read through the tutorial to make sure i am not missing anything.

3. Finish the tutorial. There is still something about adding a Demo4.js file.
