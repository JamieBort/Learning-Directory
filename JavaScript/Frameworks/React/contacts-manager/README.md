# Contacts Manager
This is the source code to my multi-part blog series about creating a React app:

* [Part 1 – How to Create a React App with create-react-app](http://www.andreasreiterer.at/web-development/creating-react-app-create-react-app/)
* [Part 2 – How to Create a React List Component](http://www.andreasreiterer.at/web-development/react-list-component/)
* [Part 3 – How to Connect your React App to a REST API](http://www.andreasreiterer.at/web-development/connect-react-app-rest-api/)

# Try the App
If you want to try the app, you just have to clone and run it: 

```
git clone https://github.com/areiterer/contacts-manager
cd contacts-manager
npm install
npm start
````

Your browser should open a new window for http://localhost:3000

Have fun!
