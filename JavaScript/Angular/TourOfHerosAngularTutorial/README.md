# README Tour Of Heros Angular Tutorial

This directory will house the various attempts for the ["Tour Of Heros"](https://angular.io/tutorial#tour-of-heroes-app-and-tutorial) Angular tutorial.

To that end, the first directory in this directory is:
`/LearningDirectory/JavaScript/Angular/TourOfHerosAngularTutorial/angular-tour-of-heroes`

I generated this directory from the [download exmaple](https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt6/toh-pt6.zip) found under the [Final code review](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6#final-code-review) heading.

After receiving this error
`An unhandled exception occurred: Could not find module "@angular-devkit/build-angular" from "/Users/jamiebort/Documents/DevFiles/LearningDirectory/JavaScript/Angular/TourOfHerosAngularTutorial/angular-tour-of-heroes".
See "/private/var/folders/yl/ry72pgqn3pgg7d8mpbzvdczm0000gn/T/ng-gML2C2/angular-errors.log" for further details.`
I found [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53190658).
