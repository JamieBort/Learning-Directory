# Activity: Rock, Paper, Scissors - Pair Programming

Using an `if`/`else` block, create the logic behind the classic game, Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Keep in mind that:

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beat paper
* Paper beats rock

## Directions  
You can use the following code to get started, but you'll need to create a main.js file to put it in:

```
// Variables
const computer = 'paper';
let me = 'rock'; // Change this to test your code
```

Assuming the computer *always* throws `paper`, write the conditional statement that will console log out one of the following messages based on what you change the `me` value too.

* `Looks like a tie!`
* `I win!`
* `Computer wins!`

## Solution  
Only view this once you have given the above a solid try.

## Bonus  
If time allows, spend time with your partner discussing how you could write a program that will have the computer select a random value every time. Discuss what the conditional statement might look like in that instance.

Note: This can be a complex problem to solve, so no need to write code, just start the conversation.

## Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
