# Activity: Character counter - Pair Programming

In this exercise, you will write a Node program that you can interact with. Write a program that prompts you for some text, and then tells you how many characters are in that text.

Example output:

~~~
What is the input text? I like bananas.
I like bananas has 15 characters.
~~~
To complete this activity, you will need to use the readline module. See the first example to see how your program should work.

## Hard Mode

* Put the input text in quotes when repeating it.
* Pluralize the second sentence correctly, so that if the user enters just one character, it says "has 1 character."

## Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
