# Activity: Arrays, Objects, and Loops - Pair Programming

## Instructions  
In this activity, your task is to complete the unfinished functions. Instructions accompany each function explaining what the function should do and what value it should return. You will implement logic using loops, conditional statements, arrays, and objects to return the values specified in the instructions.

All of the function tasks can be found in `script.js`.

The `test.js` file contains tests for all of the functions in this activity. Do not change any code in `test.js`. To see the output from `test.js` and to evaluate your work, open `index.html` in Chrome and view the console in the Developer Tools. You'll know that you are finding success when all of the `console.log` statements print 'true'.

## Getting Started  
Download the zip file.

Once downloaded, open the `starter_files` folder in your text editor and then open `index.html` in the Chrome browser.

## Your role as a student

Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
