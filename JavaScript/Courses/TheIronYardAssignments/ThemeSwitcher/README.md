# Activity: Theme Switcher - Pair Programming
You will sometimes change `class` and `id` attributes in response to user action, which can be helpful when styles need to change dynamically in your designs. For this activity, you will complete the `main.js` file and add new behaviors to the page in response to button clicks.

This activity has two parts:

## Part 1 - Changing the Theme Art  
Your task is to add click event listeners to each of the buttons. When each button is "clicked," change the `id` attribute of the body element to a different value.

* When the "KITTENS" button is "clicked," change the `id` of `body` to "kittens"
* When the "NEO TOKYO" button is "clicked," change the `id` of `body` to "tokyo"
* When the "HEAVY METAL" button is "clicked," change the `id` of `body` to "metal"
This behavior is demonstrated in the following .gif:

## Part 2 - Switching the Text Content  
Once the event handlers are set up for each button, alter the code so that the text of the `h1` and `p` tags changes each time the theme changes. The `resources` folder contains a text file of content.

The following .gif demonstrates the added behaviors. In addition to changing the theme, each click event changes the text contents of the `h1` and `p` tags.

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
