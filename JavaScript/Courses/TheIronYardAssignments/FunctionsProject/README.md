# Functions Project
Solve problems relating to functions and complex expressions.

Download the **starter_files** zip below and open in your favorite text editor. Open up the `main.js` file and write the functions that it asks you to. You should also write an example of calling the function and when you view your console in Chrome, you should not see any errors.
