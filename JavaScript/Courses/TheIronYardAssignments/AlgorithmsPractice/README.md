# Activity: Algorithms Practice - Pair Programming
This activity contains four coding challenges designed to give you practice authoring algorithms. Take your time and read the instructions carefully. Complete the functions by implementing the algorithm and returning the desired result. Read the instructions to determine how to assess your code.

You'll find all of the functions in `main.js`.

The `test.js` file contains tests for all of the functions in this activity. Do not change any code in `test.js`. To see the output from `test.js` and to evaluate your work, open index.html in Chrome and view the console in the Developer Tools. You'll know that you are finding success when all of the `console.log` statements print 'true'.

Work with your group to interpret the instructions, strategize a way to solve the challenge with code, and implement the code.

Some of these challenges are hard. You may only complete one or two of them. Don't sweat it. You can always come back and try to complete the more difficult ones at a later date. This activity is intended to give you practice.

## Files  
The exercises are located in `main.js` in the 'starterfiles' folder. Open `index.html` (also in the 'starterfiles' folder) in your browser and open the console to see the failing assertion statements.

## Getting Started  
Download the zip file.

Once downloaded, open the `starter_files` folder in your text editor and then open `index.html` in the Chrome browser.

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
