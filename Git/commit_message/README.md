### Resources to explore

These will be deleted when I am done with them. If they are of use they'll be moved to the [Vetted Resources](#vetted-resources) section below. Or a relevant file/directory in this directory.

- For the [commit_message_notes/](./commit_message_notes/) directory

  (and by extension, the [commit_message_templates/](./commit_message_templates/) directory),

  [5.2 Distributed Git - Contributing to a Project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project)

  > Getting in the habit of creating quality commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your messages should start with a single line thatâ€™s no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation...

  And there is

  ```
  Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

  More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
  characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
  subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
  line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
  the body entirely); tools like rebase will confuse you if you run the
  two together.

  Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
  or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
  by commands like git merge and git revert.

  Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

  - Bullet points are okay, too

  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

  - Use a hanging indent
  ```

  **And more.**
