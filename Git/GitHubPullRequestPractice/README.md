** All comments, questions and suggestions welcome. **

1. Clone this repository.

2. Create a branch. Then checkout that branch. Then edit file(s) on that branch.

3. Create a pull request for me to pull your changes into my repository.

4. Now pair up with at least one other person. One of you create a repository or fork this one.

5. Create a another branch. Check out that branch that you just created. Edit file(s) on that branch.

6. Now create a pull request to merge those files into the master branch.

Another repository for more git practice: [Fork practice](https://github.com/JamieBort/GitHubPractice).
