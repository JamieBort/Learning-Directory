# Code Of Conduct

## Purpose

This directory houses information about behavior while contributing to Git (GitHub ?) repos.

## Resources to explore

Resources to explore for the code_of_conduct_notes.md file.

They'll be deleted when I am done with them.

Additionally they will be referenced in the code_of_conduct_notes.md file if I use them there.
