## What?

> A good commit message
>
> - starts with a short, one-line summary of what the fix is.
> - describes the fix, not the bug.
> - doesn't just repeat or copy-n-paste the Jira issue summary.

> - add a paragraph, or two or three if necessary
> - explaining the motivation for the change
> - how some of the moving parts fit together
> - this might include what was happening previously and why that didn’t work.

> - A commit message is like a good code comment
> - it should detail the `why?`.
> - it should not detail the what or the actual code changes — the diff does that

> - add a link to the Jira ticket or supporting information, such as the StackOverflow answer you copied the code from.

## Why?

From [Writing Good Commit Messages](https://medium.com/compass-true-north/writing-good-commit-messages-fc33af9d6321) by Ben Hoyt Sep 26, 2018

> Context - If a reviewer can see the context and motivation for a change in the commit message, they won’t have to come ask you for it.
> Good history - Good commit messages are invaluable for when we refer back to it months later.
> Increases [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) - Writing a thorough commit message puts all the context in your head “on paper” before you forget about it. This shares the knowledge with the reviewer, but it also documents it for the rest of the team.

- Note - `bus factor` was a new phrase to me so I kept the entire quote without paraphrasing it, link and all.
