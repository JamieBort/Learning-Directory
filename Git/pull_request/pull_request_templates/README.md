# Pull Request Templates

## Purpose

This directory houses information about Pull Requests Templates.

## About

Pull Requests Templates are files that display info to the person creating a pull request. For example it can prompt the person to make sure that certain actions were taken before submitting the pull request.

Issue templates need to go in the `./.github/` directory.

See `https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/tree/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as an example.

**Maybe** the template has to be in the master/main branch before it will work.
