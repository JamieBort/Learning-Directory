## Notes

I'd like my Pull Request templates to ask the user to describe the following

The acronym SCQA stands for Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer.

**Situation**
The Situation should be the opener for your description. For example, if your PR is updating a React version, it could highlight what features are updated in React and how they could benefit the projects.

**Complication**
The Complication is the opportunity for you to share things that need comments or were difficult to implement. It can also be a place to explain how your change fits or doesn't fit with the current structure of the codebase. This is your opportunity to educate the reviewer and provide context for the documentation to go alongside your change.

**Question**
The Question seems obvious, but some folks are unsure how to use this. I leverage the Question as the title of my issues if needed, but I also help reiterate the change I am solving. It is possible to include scope creep into a PR unintentionally, and the Question--What does this change do? I can keep you on track in your description.

I also use the Question to get unstuck when using a trick I don't have time to get into now but will in a future postâ€”PR early, even when you are no finished.

**Answer**
The Answer is meant to describe your change and document your approach. If you skip the previous steps, you cannot skip this -- it is required. Explaining your difference not only helps your reviewers, but it also enables you to discover if your change was necessary or the best approach.
