[The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/)

> Everything you've ever wondered about the legal side of open source, and a few things you didn't.

- [Why do people care so much about the legal side of open source?](https://opensource.guide/legal/#why-do-people-care-so-much-about-the-legal-side-of-open-source)

  > [The law] also apply when someone contributes to your project. Without a license or other agreement in place, any contributions are exclusively owned by their authors. That means nobody – not even you – can use, copy, distribute, or modify their contributions.

  > Finally, your project may have dependencies with license requirements that you weren’t aware of. Your project’s community, or your employer’s policies, may also require your project to use specific open source licenses. We’ll cover these situations below.
