## Getting Started

### Setup the Project Locally

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [intro repository](github.com/open-sauced/intro) to your own GitHub account.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/intro.git
   ```

3. Navigate to and open the project in your code editor.

   ```bash
   cd intro
   ```

4. Run the project.

### Running the Project Locally

Running the project locally is essential to see your changes in real-time and test them thoroughly when you're contributing.

We recommend one of these two methods for running the project on your local machine:

1. Using the [Docsify CLI](https://docsify.js.org/#/).
2. Leveraging Visual Studio Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

#### Method 1: Using the Docsify CLI

1. **Install Node.js**.

   You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Docsify globally**.

   It's highly recommended to install Docsify globally. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g docsify-cli
   ```

3. **Run the project**.

   ```bash
   docsify serve
   ```

   This command will start a local development server, and you can access the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Make and test changes**.

   With the local server running, you can make changes to the files and immediately see the results in your browser. Test your changes thoroughly.

5. **Stop the server**.

   After completing and testing the changes, you can stop the local server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

#### Method 2: Using Live Server Extension on Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Live Server extension allows you to launch a local development server and preview your changes in real time in your browser.

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**.

   Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it if you haven't.

2. **Open the project in VS Code**.

   Launch VS Code, open the project folder by selecting "File" > "Open Folder", and choose the project directory.

3. **Install the Live Server extension**.

   - Click "View" on the top bar of the VS Code.
   - Click "Extensions".

   Alternatively, press the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open the "Extensions" menu.

   - Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and install it.

4. **Launch the Live Server**.

   Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom-right corner of the VS Code window. It will open the project in a new tab on your browser at a local address.

5. **Make and test changes**.

   With the Live Server running, you can make changes to the files using VS Code, and the changes will be automatically reflected in your browser. Test your changes thoroughly.

6. **Stop the Live Server**.

   When you're done testing or making changes, you can stop the Live Server by clicking the "Port: 5500" button in the VS Code status bar at the bottom-right corner.

## Working with the Content

The contents of this course are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Please read the [Using Markdown for This Project](#using-markdown-for-this-project) section for details about how to use Markdown in this project.

### Adding Definitions to the Glossary

If you add definitions to the [Glossary](10-glossary.md) chapter, ensure the definitions are added in **alphabetical order**.

### Adding a New Section to a Chapter

If your content can fall under the category of one of the course chapters, consider adding it as a new section to the chapter. Create a `heading 2` title and write your content.

You can add a new chapter if it's more suitable for a standalone section.

### Adding a New Chapter and Adding it to the Sidebar

In this section, we will walk you through how to add a new chapter to our Intro to Open Source course and add it to the sidebar.

#### Adding a New Chapter

Follow these steps to add a new chapter to our course:

1. **Create a new Markdown file**.

   Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file in the root and name the file to reflect the chapter's content‚Äîfor example, `how-to-contribute-to-open-source.md` for a chapter about how to contribute to open source.

   > **NOTE**: Be sure to follow naming conventions. Notice that file names are not capitalized, and there are hyphens in place of spaces between words.

2. **Determine the chapter's number**.

   We have specific conventions for numbering file names to maintain a consistent structure. In this project, the numbers in the file name represent chapters‚Äîfor example, `01-intro`, `02-what-is-open-source`, `03-why-open-source`, etc.

   Consider where the new chapter you'll work on logically falls in the course.

   If you're not sure, please comment on the issue and tag the `@open-sauced/community` maintainers to ask for help.

3. **Write content**.

   Open the newly created Markdown file in a text editor and write the content for your chapter using the Markdown syntax. You can include headings, text, images, links, lists, and other elements to present your information effectively.

   > **Note**: There should only be **one** `heading 1` in each file.

4. **Ensure there are no duplicate chapter numbers, and they should be in order**.

   There should only be one number for each chapter (no duplication), and the numbers must be in order to make the course flow. You need to rename other files that follow your new file by changing the chapter number accordingly.

5. **Test your changes**.

   Before finalizing your new chapter, you should test your changes locally. You can build or render the project to ensure your new chapter appears as expected within the course structure.

6. **Update the sidebar**.

   After you add a new chapter, you must also add it to the sidebar for the users to discover the content.

#### Adding New Chapters to the Sidebar

The sidebar in our course serves as a navigation menu. So, when you add a new chapter to the course, it's important to update the sidebar by including the link to the chapter. That way, users can navigate to the content seamlessly.

Follow these steps to add new chapters to the sidebar:

1. Navigate to `_layouts/sidebar.js`.
2. **Add the new chapter link**.

   - Insert a new line in the list based on your chapter's number. For example, if your chapter number is `07`, insert this new line right after `06`.
   - Use the below format to add the link to the new chapter:

     ```markdown
     - [Intro](https://github.com/01-intro.md)
     ```

     - Replace `Intro` with the title of your new chapter. _Be sure to capitalize the title_.
     - Replace `/01-intro.md` with the relative path to the Markdown file of your new chapter.

3. **Ensure the chapter's numbers are in order**.

   The chapter's numbers should be in order. So, you must change the chapter numbers in the relative paths that follow the new chapter.

4. **Create a pull request**.

   Once you have created the new chapter and verified that it meets our project's requirements, you can submit your contribution by creating a pull request.

5. **Review and feedback**.

   Wait for maintainers to review your pull request, and be prepared to receive feedback from them or collaborators. Make changes if necessary to refine your contribution.

After your contribution is accepted, your new chapter will become part of our course, enhancing its content for users and contributors.

## Using Markdown for This Project

We have a [style guide](https://github.com/open-sauced/pizza-verse/blob/main/style-guide.md) to use Markdown for our projects. So, when contributing to this project, you must follow this convention.

### Markdown Basics

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language that allows you to format text in a readable and visually appealing way.

Below are some Markdown elements that you will commonly use in this project with examples, following our style guide:

#### 1. Headings

Use the hash (`#`) symbol to create headings (titles and subtitles). There are six levels of section headings, and the number of symbols indicates the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```

#### 2. Text Formatting

- Make text bold by enclosing it with double asterisks (`**`).
- Make text italic by enclosing it with single underscores (`_`).
- Create inline code by wrapping text with backticks (`` ` ``).

```markdown
**This is a bold text.**

_This is an italic text._

This is an `inline code`.
```

#### 3. Lists

- Create ordered lists using numbers followed by a period (`1.`, `2.`, etc.).
- Create unordered lists using hyphens (`-`).

```markdown
1.  Item 1
2.  Item 2

- Unordered Item 1
- Unordered Item 2
```

#### 4. Links

Create links using square brackets (`[]`) for the link text and parentheses (`()`) for the URL.

```markdown
[Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced](https://intro.opensauced.pizza/#/)
```

#### 5. Images

Embed images using an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by square brackets (`[]`) for the alt text, and parentheses (`()`) for the image URL.

```markdown
![OpenSauced Highlights](https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/blob/main/images/opensauced-highlights.png)
```

#### 6. Blockquotes

Create blockquotes using the greater-than symbol (`>`).

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

#### 7. Code Blocks

Create code blocks using triple backticks (` ``` `) for fenced code blocks and specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block to highlight the syntax.

````
```bash
git pull
```
````

### Markdown Tips

- Preview your Markdown locally to ensure proper formatting before submitting your contribution.
- Keep your Markdown content organized, and use headings to structure your sections.
- There can only be one `heading 1` in each chapter.
- Use code blocks to highlight code snippets or configuration examples.
- Check out the official [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) website for more information about using Markdown.
