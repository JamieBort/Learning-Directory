These will be deleted when I am done with them. If they are of use they'll be moved to the [Vetted Resources](#vetted-resources) section below. Or a relevant file/directory in this directory.

NOTE: More good contributing examples might be found in the repos highlighted in this [issue_templates/](../../issues/issue_templates/) directory or this [pull_request_templates/](../../pull_request/pull_request_templates/) directory.

I like how this one uses automation for self-assigning Issues. See the section that mentions `.take`.

And that there is a `Getting Started` section that explicitly tells you how to start contributing.

And I like that there is a Style Guide to "document is a general style to help you format your PR."
