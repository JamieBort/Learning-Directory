# Contributing Notes

## Who?

## What?

From Mozilla Science Lab [Wrangling Web Contributions: How to Build a CONTRIBUTING.md](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/)

> A CONTRIBUTING.md file, in your open source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group. It is convention to capitalize the word "contributing" as the file title, and to save it as a resource in markdown (hence the extension .md).

## When?

## Where?

## Why?

## Things to consider

- People contributing to a project my not have any coding experience. For example, they may wish to suggest a new feature. In which case the instructions on how to suggest one (and all other aspects of contributing) should be understood by anyone, not solely people versed in GitHub.

- Adding a table of contents if the contribution file is long.

- Adding instructions on how to submit pull requests. Including linking to the Pull Request Template, assuming there is one. How to submit a change in the code.

- Linking to the Code of Conduct.

- Adding instructions on how to request an enhancement. A feature rather than a bug.

- Adding instructions on how to report a bug.

- Adding instructions on where to ask for help.

- Adding a glossary.

- Adding a section listing the following:

  - Project owners - creators and maintainers of the file

  - Project contributors - users of the file who want to know items they're welcome to tackle, and tact they need in navigating the project/respecting those involved with the project

  - Project consumers - users who want to build off the project to create their own project
