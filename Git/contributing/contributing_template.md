- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

<!-- To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/README.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see "[Using Markdown and Liquid in GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-markdown-and-liquid-in-github-docs)." -->

<!-- TODO: Rather than link to a separate file, list the types of contributions in this file here. -->

<!-- Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:. -->

### Types of contributions we're looking for

- Any problems (bugs) with the code.
- Updates to the documentation. For example improved wording in the README files, in this Contribution file, etc.
- A suggested feature.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

<!-- TODO: Link to a brief description/tutorial on how to search for GitHub Issues. -->

If you observe a problem with this repo that falls into one of the three types listed above, please first see if that issue already exists.

- If so, feel free to add any new info to that Issue via the comments in that Issue.

<!-- TODO: Link to a brief description/tutorial on creating GitHub Issues. -->

- And if that Issue does not already exist, please create a new GitHub Issue.

<!-- If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). -->

#### Solve an issue

Another option to contribute is to solve an existing issue.

<!-- TODO: Link to a brief description/tutorial on how to search for GitHub Issues. -->
<!-- TODO: FOR THIS TEMPLATE: Replace `<replace_with_the_repo_name>` with the name of the repo. -->

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/JamieBort/<replace_with_the_repo_name>/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See "[Label reference](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/label-reference)" for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

<!-- #### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. -->

 <!-- <img src="/contributing/images/contribution_cta.png" /> -->

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs/working-on-github-docs-in-a-codespace)."

#### Make changes locally

<!-- TODO: Link to a brief description/tutorial on how to fork the repo. -->

1. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:

  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

<!-- 2. Install or update to **Node.js**, at the version specified in `.node-version`. For more information, see [the development guide](../contributing/development.md). -->

<!-- TODO: Link to a brief description/tutorial on how to create a working branch. -->

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to use the "[Self review checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist)" to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
