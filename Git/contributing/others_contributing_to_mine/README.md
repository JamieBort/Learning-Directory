## Purpose

<!-- The purpose of this directory is to [...]. -->

## About

This directory houses information for other people about contributing to repos that belong to me.

## Resources to explore

I am using these to take notes in this [contributing_notes.md](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory/blob/master/Git/contributing/contributing_notes.md) file.

When I am done reading through each one I will remove it from this section. If I use information from one of them in my notes, I'll reference it there.
