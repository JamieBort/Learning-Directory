# My Issue Templates

NOTE: I have an issue template for bugs and one for features, but I do not have one for updating documentation. And the [contributing_template.md](../../../contributing/contributing_template.md#types-of-contributions-were-looking-for) file lists bugs, features, and updates to documentation as three possible ways to contribute.

TODO: Update my Issue templates with the requirement to acknowledge the code of conduct file(s) and contributing docs. To that end, see these https://github.com/open-sauced/intro/issues/ Issues for examples.

## Purpose

This directory houses information about my Issue templates.

## About

Right now there is just one template in here.

I anticipate needing and/or using at least a few templates over time. This is where they will live.
