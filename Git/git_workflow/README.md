# Git Workflow

Related: [actions](../actions/) directory.

## Purpose

<!-- The purpose of this directory is to [...]. -->

I created this directory to document the best way to "collaborate" with myself in my repos.

<!-- NOTE: See brainstorm in this https://github.com/JamieBort/Learning-Directory/issues/248 Issue. -->

## About

Currently these directories were thrown together just to put some thoughts down "on paper". I'll clean them up as I return to them.
