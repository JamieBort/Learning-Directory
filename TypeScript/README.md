# TypeScript

This directory houses all the TypeScript courses, projects, and coding challenges I have started and completed.

This directory should have ONLY the following directies in it, plus this readme file:
1. `Courses`
2. `Coding Challenges` and
3. `Projects`

as defined in this [Explanation of files and directories](https://github.com/JamieBort/LearningDirectory#explanation-of-files-and-directories) section; and this readme file.

~~Note: Added the `Java_Specific_Concepts` directory to work on Packages.~~

## Courses
Udemy courses and the like.
Tutorials.

## Coding Challenges
Exercises from sites such as CodeWars.com

### Projects
I don't think this should be in here any more. But will leave it for now.
