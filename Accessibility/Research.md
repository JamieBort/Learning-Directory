## Accessability-specific questions to have answered

Of particular interest: User accessible navigation - color blind and screenreader friendly

What to keep in mind?

- color/contrast issues (if my site isn't sufficient, add button to toggle on visually sufficient them)

- screen readers

- integrate screen reader into my page so that the end user can have the page read to them by the "click of a button" without having them download or install anything.

- What's the difference between screen reader(s) and chrome (or mac os) voice over?
  [See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lktz1KXbTOU)

- how to share my resume/cv and name it so that it's most accessible?

- What is NVDA?

- keyboard only manipulation of the website.

- understanding focus through the page and making sure it is handled properly

- style buttons properly

- style links properly

- Which tools are available to test with?

- Which resources are there for learning about this?

- Which resources are there me to use as an end user - if I want to list to a text-based site for example?

- what else?
