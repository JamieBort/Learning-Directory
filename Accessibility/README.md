# Accessibility

## Purpose
A directory to use to hone my accessibility exploration. Specifically so that I can make my website(s) more accessible.

## Status

## Next Steps
Which tools are available to test with?

Which resources are there for learning about this?

Which resources are there me to use as an end user - if I want to list to a text-based site for example?

## Questions
Of particular interest: User accessible navigation - color blind and screenreader friendly

What to keep in mind?

* color/contrast issues (if my site isn't sufficient, add button to toggle on visually sufficient them)
* screen readers
* integrate screen reader into my page so that the end user can have the page read to them by the "click of a button" without having them download or install anything.
* What's the difference between screen reader(s) and chrome (or mac os) voice over?
[See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lktz1KXbTOU)
* how to share my resume/cv and name it so that it's most accessible?
* What is NVDA?
* keyboard only manipulation of the website.
* understanding focus through the page and making sure it is handled properly
* style buttons properly
* style links properly
* what else?
